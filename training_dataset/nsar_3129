The Bible falls completely silent on the issue of abortion. All direct condemnations on abortion found in the New Testament were quickly discarded as irrelevant by theologians. Christianity had it's chance at condemning abortion in the Bible and choose not to!For hundreds of years the Vatican supported abortion rights. Even it's most celebrated saints were not only outspoken supporters but blazed a path for theology to support it. And in early America, it wasn't rare for abortion services to be posted on Church bulletinboards. Again, these are facts that the pro-life/Christian-Con movement you never find out about. They would rather have you believe in lies instead for their political agendas.
