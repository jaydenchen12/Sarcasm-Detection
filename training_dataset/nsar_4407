atheism is not a belief in the typical sense. it is a non-belief. it is the abscence of belief.  a theist is one who beleives in one form of a diety or another.  the prefix 'a' means without. thus an atheist is one without a beleif in one form of a diety or another. as to the idea of your question my non beleif comes from the lack of evidence and logic in support of god as well as a lack of understanding of what is meant by 'god'.
