since evolutionism and creationism are both attempting to answer the same question, (i.e., how come existence?) they are mutally exclusive, and if one is true, it automatically falsifies the other. this means that if evolutionism is accepted as true, then logically creationism, and by extension the entire bible, is false. the notion that the bible is completely and uncompromisingly true is paramount to christianity.with all that in consideration, it should be no surprise that christians will do everything possible to show evolution as false
