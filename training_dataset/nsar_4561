my biggest problem with the gay rights issue is their tireless and often deceptive efforts to drag science into the whole thing. we know that there is nothing that ties biology and genes into sexual orientation, yet the gay society insists that there is, supporting shabby studies with inconclusive results and publishing them as facts. i have absolutely no problem with the gay lifestyle, marriage rights or social place. but when it must be done under the guise of false science, there is a problem from what ive seen, homosexuality, and sexuality on a whole, is indeed a complex issue. it is misunderstood, and many 'authorities' on the subject submit conflicting reports, making the issue even more complicated. not only that, but people guard their sexuality with strong emotions, and therefore tend to believe what they want to believe about it. it makes finding the truth 10 times more difficult.
