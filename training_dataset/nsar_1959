1. Are you referring to "Christian" creationism? Intelligent Design? If so, then it's nothing more than a Christio-centric argument. There's no difference between Christian Creationism/ ID and the Wapuri warrior ideal creation myth which focuses on the divine Parrot.If you are focusing on Christian creationism vs Evolution, there is more than one system of creation, and it doesn't necessarily revolve around one omnipotent, omniscient being. It could be an accident as well!What one thing is an obvious fact from History? You are talking about western civilization. Western Civilization's religious beliefs aren't the be-all, end all, of creation...there's as reason to believe in spontaneous generation as there is in Christian Creationism. You can also use any eastern or south american or native american belief system of creation.
