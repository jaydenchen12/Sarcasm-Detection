Anyone and everyone who is fed up with Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer, the liar Chris Dodd, the incompetent Harry Reid, carnal left-wing hedonism, people who erringly bow down to obese Buddha-like statues that can't hear and can't talk or reason; pseudo-Christians like Barack Obama and his followers who forgot to read Psalm 139:13 and Jeremiah 1:5, so they push infanticide/abortion; trillion-dollar budget-busting socialists who put America in incredible debt because they want their feel-good Utopia to come to pass; left-wing politicians who will run their mouths about Iran building a nuclear weapon but are too dumb and gutless to do anything about it; and anyone who looks or thinks like Barney Franks. That for starters.
