i've hardly ever heard any christian try to convince anyone they are all consistent and harmonized. and i've been around a lot of christians. maybe you'd actually get more christians to consider your points if you'd stop flinging accusations of scams and rudely calling things that are dear to them 'fairy tales'. but hey, it's your loss.
