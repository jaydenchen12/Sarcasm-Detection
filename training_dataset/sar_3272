single payer would give you a lot less government. though border control certainly takes more. still, 'more government' or 'less government' -- this vague phrase you keep throwing out -- is not the point. the point is cost-effective health care for all americans and the integrity of our national borders, and all that goes with it. i would agree with that. don't know the writer, but i agree, it's revolting c**p. mexico is a very racist society in many ways.
