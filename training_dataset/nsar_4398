how so? do you mean to treat others, better than you would have others treat you? then you are merely a perpetual victim to sociopaths. people are not always following the golden rule, and that's where the social unrest and problems start. without some degree of this a society cannot function and there would be no social cohesion and there would be constant conflict without peace.  why does it serve them to do so? it's because we are social. it's mutual self-interest, sure, but the larger human need to interact with the other is always there. no one is an island. no one is completely selfless either. we preserve ourselves, so we may realize our full potential by some degree of social interaction and co-operation.
