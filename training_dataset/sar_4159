this liberal hypocrisy makes me sick...more and more sick.  right after monica, clinton dropped bombs in iraq. not a word from the left, silence.  clinton laid out reasons why we should carry out that extensive bombing campaign in 1998. no un resolution, no congressional votes, no complaints from the left.  clinton tooks us to fight dictators killing thousands in their countries over and over. not a word from the left. saddam is doing the same...words from the left. i'm tired...i'll add later.
