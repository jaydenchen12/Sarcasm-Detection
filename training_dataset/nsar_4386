absolutely. even worse are the rights of unmarried fathers, who seem to have no rights whatsoever just because they never married the mother of the child. i completely believe that fathers can be just as good parents as mothers, even better in some cases.  but everything is mother centred when it comes to parenting, for example, why are baby changing areas always within the womens toilets? what are men supposed to do if they take out their baby themselves? off topic i know but it's infuriating!
