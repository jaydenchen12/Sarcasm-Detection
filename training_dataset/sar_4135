you consider this refuting my evidence? what amazes me is that you all scoff at creationism, yet this is the best most of you can offer to refute scientific evidence which supports the flood. a) i'm not a member there. and 2) have you ever whistled in the wind? why would i waste my time on a forum which specializes in promoting the evo lies and scientific distortions in order to defend their cult religion which seek to erase god from the equation regarding how we came to be?
