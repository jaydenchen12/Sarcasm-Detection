Who on earth worships the Koran? What makes you think a catholic is likely to molest a child. There is also a big difference between beliefs and actual ownership of a deadly weapon. I also do not see how this affects anyone's "constitutional rights". You may have the right to keep and bear arms, that doesn't exempt you from being treated differently on the basis of your choice to do so, anymore than your right to free speech exempts you from being treated differently if you advocate segregation or paedophilia.
