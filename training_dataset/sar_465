It's not surprising that 21 million people would vote for Moore's feces. More than that voted for John French Kerry. In yellow dog politics, you vote for whatever the party puts up. It's been a political fiasco and the liberals are p i s s e d.To put any credence in the election, I'd have to know how it was run. Who was allowed to vote? [I didn't get a ballot.] Could people vote more than once? Did only the "liberal" city-folk and Hollywood incest droppings get to vote?If you believe that Moore's film is the best because it got the most votes, then you must believe that Bush is the best, because he did, too. Thank you.
