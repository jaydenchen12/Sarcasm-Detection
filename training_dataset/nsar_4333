i do understand that, but equally those who are pro-life would doubtless think differently. possibly in the example you gave, but what of a very late pregnancy, one that is not an early fetus and could easily exist if a csarian for example were performed? self-aware too is not necessarily a get-out clause. what of people in deep comas who are arguably not self-aware either? or for that matter a baby, when does ones concept of 'self' actually begin? but it can be argued that the impact on the child's life is significantly greater than that on the parents. existance is after all pretty much the biggest impact on anyone. to be fair i'm playing devil's advocate here really, as i am broadly pro-choice myself. i was just struck by the similarity of the arguments in 'the parents right to choose ends when it affects the child's life'.
