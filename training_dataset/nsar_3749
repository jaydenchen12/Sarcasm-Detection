my dear, i don't know who first invented the word 'christianist', but i saw it used frequently on andrew sullivan's website, and he's no liberal, just another christian conservative, only not a complete idiot. it denotes the sort of bigots who think that not only are christians better than anyone else, but that everyone else should be compelled to abide by the religious laws desired by christianists. not all christians are christianists. but you can recognise a christianist by his bigotry, and opposition to everyone who isn't like him. christianists believe that the only legitimate government is one that lives by their religious principles. there are lots of them around, virtually all supporters of the gop. that's your crowd.
