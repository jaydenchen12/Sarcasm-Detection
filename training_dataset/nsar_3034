My husband and I will be married in windsor this comming June. It will be good that there will be one place in this world that our family will be considered a family. There is nothing the conservatives, republicans, or chistonazis can do to stop or take this license from us. I might just do a twist and sue in Canadian courts to have all marriages preformed in the United States not be recognized. So all those heteros passing into Canada will not be considered married unless married in Canada. Wounldn't that be a hoot.
