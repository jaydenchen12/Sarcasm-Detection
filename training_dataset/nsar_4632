always a case that slips through the cracks... well how about we focus on the genuine problem instead of making something else into a problem. instead of playing the game 'what new law can we pass now' let's do something to focus on the one million dangerous gang members we've got running around free. they've been linked to 80% of the crimes committed in the country, there's no justified excuse for not going after them.
