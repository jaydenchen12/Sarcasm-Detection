those who don't have god as their moral compass are the ones who are responsible for 99% of crimes committed to humanity. what are you talking about? except for communists i can't think of any crimes committed by atheists. as for crimes committed by people who believe in god? pick a war...seriously, pick any war before communism came about and most wars after it and you'll see that in every case the leader of that nation and nearly the entire population of that nation believes in god. honestly you may deserve a prize for having created the most demonstrably wrong statements on this site. congrats!
