and neither did trebor post any evidence of his claim. why aren't you questioning him? but i suspect that trebor has asked those with better recollections of the time than he has and they have confirmed for him that what i said is true, which is why he hasn't come back and refuted my response to him. i know this info is true. i just couldn't find anything on-line that stated when isaiah was dropped from the traditional reading in american jewish temples. sorry...
