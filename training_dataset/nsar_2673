What's the point of posting a bunch of propaganda from some biased website? Your whole post proves nothing because it doesn't show a causal relationship between gun control and mass murder. How come Sadam Hussein was able to kill so many of his subjects although gun ownership was common among the Iraqi public? I suppose we could find a way to blame all the world's problems on gun-control. Even this pro-gun website admits that you can't blame the holocaust on gun-control. "The simple conclusion is that there are no lessons about the efficacy of gun control to be learned from the Germany of the first half of this century. It is all too easy to forget the seductive allure that fascism presented to all the West, bogged down in economic and social morass. What must be remembered is that the Nazis were master manipulators of popular emotion and sentiment, and were disdainful of people thinking for themselves. There is the danger to which we should pay great heed. Not fanciful stories about Nazi's seizing guns." http://www.guncite.com/gun_control_gcnazimyth.html
