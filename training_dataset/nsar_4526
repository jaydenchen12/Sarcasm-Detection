the big problem is that most of that tax money neither goes towards the needs or the wants of the american people, and all the tax money is coming from the middle class. while the less than 5% wealthy doesn't pay any taxes after their tax returns. if we solved this problem then we would have more than enough money to pay for a free health care.
