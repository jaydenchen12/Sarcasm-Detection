i believe dametel is referring to leviticus 20:13 - 'if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. they must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.' dametel hasn't discovered yet that in the new testament it is god who exercises this type of punishment when he deems fit, instead of man.
