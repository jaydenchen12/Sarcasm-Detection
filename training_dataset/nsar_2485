Caged reasoning on both sides but yet each faction has a similiar goal; to decline the rate of abortion. Pro-lifers feel that legal restriction to outright criminalization will complete this goal. Pro-choicers feel that the means to control fertility through contraception will do. I believe moderate pro-lifers and pro-choicers can come to a comfortable compromise.
