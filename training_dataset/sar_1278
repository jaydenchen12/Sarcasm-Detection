Also, all in all I felt that the inauguration was fun to watch. Laura Bush was simply stunning--there's no other way to put it. She stole the show in my opinion, with her gracefulness and the Oscar De la Renta she was wearing. It was like watching Jacklyn Kennedy all over again. Bush seemed to be having a great time too.The protestors came across looking like total party-poopers on this one, BTW. Like it or not, people were just trying to have fun.
