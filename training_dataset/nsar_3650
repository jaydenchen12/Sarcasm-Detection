just in case anyone's interested, recent research into bumblebee flight was conducted by professor ismet gursul at the university of bath, uk. the paper was titled 'unsteady vortex flows over slender delta wings' and appeared in the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics journal last year, i believe. i can't find any direct info from the paper online, but here's a short article about it: research cracks puzzle of why the bumble bee can fly so well  and just because i'm a pedant, it's spelt gullible! i think i've seen 3 or 4 different spellings of it in this thread. no offense, i am just a massive spelling pedant.
