Well said Jito. I don't understand why pro-lifers dismiss pregnancy as easy and/or suggest that it's a wonderful snuggly thing that's just the best thing in the world. Even if you want a baby, it's unbelievably hard to go through and something your body never fully recovers from. If you don't want a baby and are being forced to go through it, it's unbearable. You can't force somebody to go through this life-threatening condition that is always physically harmful.
