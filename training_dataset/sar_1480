I think it should be legalized for medical use only (reducing the pain, nausea, and weight loss caused by AIDS). If it can ease the pain and suffering of someone, that's fine. I see no use for it other than that. What kind of society will we live in when people can freely smoke something that is 5 times more cancerous than cigarettes, causes lung damage, and pregnancy complications. It impairs motor coordination, reaction time, and it's a mild hallucinogen; great, another thing to have to test motorists for. Drunk driving isn't even under control yet, why should there be something else to monitor. It can change the brain chemistry and makes the brain more open for such other drugs as cocaine and heroin: gateway drug. I just don't think it's a good idea.Used information from "Psychology Seventh Edition" David G. Myers
