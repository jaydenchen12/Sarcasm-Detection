First off, just because some Iraq's are crazy and use their children as weapons, does not mean all Iraqi's are such. Second, I think people use the younger people for wars for a couple of reasons. One reason is they are easier to convince to do something like go to war than a guy that is 40 or older. Every country uses their young people for war. They are also more physically fit. .
