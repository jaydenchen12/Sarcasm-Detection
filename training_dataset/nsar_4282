Please, where has daewoo praised allah?  The problem is alot of us are not athiests. I dispise all organized religions. That's not the point though. Getting a religious fanatic to argue without religion is virtually impossible. Neither Daewoo or anyone vor calls a liberal has done so.  that's questionable. Bin Laden has gained quite a bit from Bush's policies. thousands of recruits, a terror playground, a huge amount of soft targets. If I was Bin Laden, I'd vote for Bush. After all, the search has all but stopped for him and the US is being bled dry in a number of areas under Bush's leadership.
