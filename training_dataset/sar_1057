You made an assertion of fact, and it is therefore your job to establish its veracity with reputable evidence.The argument from (or "appeal to") ignorance is a logical fallacy which claims that a premise is true ("Canadians are coming over the border for our health system in hoards, while abandoning theirs") only because it has not been proven false.Ergo, you lose.
