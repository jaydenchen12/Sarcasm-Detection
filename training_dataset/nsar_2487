If the UK were consistant then you may have a point. But you Anti-Social, Socialist tyranny of a government ARRESTS and JAILS Tony Martin for the CRIME of SELF DEFENSE and they let the Burgular go free. Not only free but your courts deemed that Tony Martin Made the "environment hazardous to the burgular trade" Tony Martin who has NEVER been charged with a crime is serving how many years? (10 plus?) while the HOME INVADER got out in less than 1 and continued his trade.......The problem though is that YOU worry about a 12 year old with a water pistol as opposed the the CRIMINAL invading your homes...You live in a Sick Sad World my friend.
