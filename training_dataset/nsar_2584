You can have all sorts of discussion about pain etc. You can come up with useful ways of helping people cope. However when you fully understand and aspect of pain in terms of nerve impulses and how your fancy painkiller stops them that is a better result. So restricting yourself to what you can measure can have results and should not be dismissed as "bad because all restrictions are bad".
