5 year olds believe in a lot of things. Many believe in Santa Claus, because they have faith. As a child I believed in childish things. But, I grew up.I am sorry, but I don't see the need for pity for rejecting superstition. I have heard that 'I used to be an atheist' nonsense by so many, yet I don't see the understanding about what it means to be an 'atheist'.
