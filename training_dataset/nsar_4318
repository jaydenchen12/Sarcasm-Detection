Sorry, I did swerve a bit on the original topic. The concept of the Nicene and Chalcedonian Christian was a new concept for me and very engrossing, inasmuch as, in contrast to the aforementioned faiths, Mennonites and other such Anabaptists didn't seem to focus exclusively on the eternal life of the believer as being the most important aspect of faith. I am inclined to believe that the desperation of one to "exist forever" is a very selfish conceit and leads to contempt for the rest of society.
