It depends on what you mean by "the wild". If you release a wolf in his natural enviroment and realese a democrat in his natural enviroment, I`m pretty sure the democrat will outlive the wolf. If you release a wolf in the democrats enviroment, the wolf will die rather quickly. If you release a democrat in the wolves enviroment, he stands a decent chance of outliving the wolf (he merely needs to get back into a town)
