They are different terms and apply to different things. Secularism is not a worldview in itself, it is a policy of how to apply religious and other worldview in real life.Secularism does not exclude people with a religious worldview. One may imagine a devout christian that firmly believes in his faith, but is also convinced that faith must come from within and that forcing someone to behave in accordance with a religion simply encourages false faith, and would logically conclude that his faith should not be forced upon people (usually with the subclause of "Let them burn in hell afterwards", or something else along those lines).
