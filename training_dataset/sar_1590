My God! Archy isn't even aware of the centuries of quibbling and waffling and just-so answers that have gone on among theologians about the problem of evil. It seems that he has never read Augustine, Aquinas, and on and on. He isn't even aware that there is even a name for arguments about the problem. It is called Theodicy.
