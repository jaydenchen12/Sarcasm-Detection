Yes we can create modern technological wonders. The pyramids, the Twin Towers, and Meer. Alas, as was so truthfully spoke by Isaac Asimov, "The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom." Just look at us and ask the question "What are we doing?" There are some of us that are attacking innocent civilians, others who won't lift a finger to help out of sheer arrogance, others who are too decadent to do anything.
