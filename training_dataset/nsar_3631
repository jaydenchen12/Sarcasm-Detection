why even bother with courts? between the nancy grace's of the world and several other people i have noticed, there is no longer any such thing as innocent. therefore, perhaps, we should just send anybody charged with a crime straight to jail and just save everybody a whole lot of time and money. i was for sure he was guilty. should i put my faith in a jury? should i put my faith in our courts? do i know better than them? i watch tv! of course i know better than them! nancy grace even says he's guilty! what more do we need to know? from now on, they should just fire all the judges and lawyers and let me decide. </sarcasm>  from now on, your future is in my hands! :p there will be no appeals! :p
