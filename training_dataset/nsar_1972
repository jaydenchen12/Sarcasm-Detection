I would disagree here about this, in terms of the pro-life view. It's not that mental existence is irrelevant ... quite the contrary; in fact it's the reality that there will SOON be mental existence that makes it matter. I don't think the issue of abortion should ever be divorced from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human being ... a human that is human by pretty much anyone's standards. So I suspect that the big difference here is that pro-choicers are more "in the moment" in terms of the way they view the fetus, and pro-lifers are more "long-term bigger-picture" in terms of the way they view the fetus. Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human.
