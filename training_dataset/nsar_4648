saw a great article today by michael bloomberg (yes, that michael bloomberg), about where the illegal guns used in crimes come from - mainly from the states with weak gun control laws. this is unsurprising to most rational folk, but yet we still hear the pro-gun clarion call to have no new gun laws, etc. so here's the article for all to read: stop spread of illegal guns from states with weak laws - cnn.com
