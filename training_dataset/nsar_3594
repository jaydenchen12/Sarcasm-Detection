http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hero she didnt really risk her own life, it was more a case of in the wrong place at the wrong time. she also did not sacrifice her life. she's still alive. to think she was any more a hero than any other serviceman or woman on the front lines is ludicrous, and to tell the truth, many of them arent heroes either. i think titles are passed around to quickly nowadays. now, if you are defending your mates who are injured from 50 ak-47 wielding terrorists and you fend them all off, in the meanwhile losing 2 ligaments, i think thats cause for the use of the title of hero. jessica lynch? hell no. it comes down to how you interpret what a hero is, for me, she is just propaganda for the bush admin (or was). those who cannot see that are fools imho. drummond
