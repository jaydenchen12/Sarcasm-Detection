So, do humans become instantly vested with this "sin" nature as soon as they pass through the defiling vagina of a woman into the world? Is there something about passing through a woman's vagina that defiles all of humanity? Whereas, the fetus in the womb is totally innocent and blameless and without sin? I'm trying to understand.
