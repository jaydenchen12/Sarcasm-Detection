Many died at the hands of slavery. But it's beside the point. Pointing out bad things that have happened in Christianity in no way refutes that good things have happened as well. You're arguing from a position of complete nonacceptance of good from religion. I'm arguing both: that religion has been good AND bad. You're ONLY arguing the bad and can't bring yourself to accept (or admit) that it has and can also be good. And when that good is pointed out with real examples, you change the subject to something that ignores the point, such as "ignorance is never good" or something like that. Well, it's NOT ignorant for Mel White to believe in equality. So religion isn't always ignorant, either.
