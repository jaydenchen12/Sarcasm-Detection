i aborted my 6 1/2 week old baby and i'm extremely offended by comments that portray me and women like me as 'violent'. i had my abortion for my own personal reasons that have nothing to do with any of you, and should not be any of your business.  steve, nobody was saying that you have to give 100% of yourself to your cause or otherwise you don't really believe in it. what they are trying to say is that you come on here and spout your opinions but you don't really seem to present any indication that you do anything in your personal life to confront abortion. i would like to call myself a revoluntionary feminist but i feel like that would be lying because i do not feel like i do enough for the cause to call myself one. see the point?
