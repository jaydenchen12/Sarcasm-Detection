He presented no arguement as to why he thought that this was not mere reflex action. As someone with only a minimum of medical knowledge, I personally cannot tell the difference between reflex action and a true sense of pain. That is true for most of us and seems to be true for this physician. I am left with having to trust scientists to distinguish between the two and scientists seem to agree that one needs a sufficiently developed cerebral cortex in order to register pain - which does not happen until the start of the third trimester.
