i don't think it's fair to put the blame on women who wear explicit clothing. there are times when self control is needed. if a man can't exercise that self control, to a point where he rapes a woman, then he does deserve jail.  this is partly right though, women do cause a lot of mixed messages when they go out wearing almost nothing. however, if she says no... it means no. and we shouldn't go around blaming the victim of a sexual assault.
