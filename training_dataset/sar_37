It doen't matter what trimester it is in. The shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life. By arguing if the baby is considered living, is just people's way of trying to justify what they already know is wrong, hoping that the excuse of "if the baby isn't conscious of it, then it isn't that wrong." It doesn't matter if the baby knows it or not. Even if it was conscious of it, it won't care in a second. The moral dilemma comes in that, you had the intent of killing and that is what makes abortion in any stage morally wrong!!!!The better question is, Should the government take action? because this is a wierd situation where the life is still 100% dependent of the mom and therefore a part of her body. The argument of a soul is negligable because there is no proof of the exsistence to of souls.I have no answer for you, just a plea to please keep an open mind and have compassion for both sides of the argument. It is the only way we can create progress and not hate.
