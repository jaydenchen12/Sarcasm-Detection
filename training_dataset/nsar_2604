I don't know what I think about this. Personally, I believed that Cain and Seth did marry their sisters. I know, sounds like incest, and today that is what it would be.However, you need to remember that there were no exact set of laws at the beginning of the creation. Almost all of God's followers were spoken to by him and were given visions and angels to tell them what to do. I don't believe it was considered incest till the law was written abolishing that sort of thing.I'm not sure about him creating other women either, but you could be right. After all, I've found the idea of him creating life on other planets AFTER the creation acceptable (still wondering about the end of the creation where he stopped though) so with that view in mind, I suppose it's possible.
