I went about this wrong. I am meaning that it would take millions of years for wings to evolve. During these millions of years, they will be undeveloped, simply masses attached to the dinosaur, and totally useless. When they reach their fully evolved form, they may have been of use, but until then, they could serve no purpose, and help the dino in no way at all, serving only as excess weight, and larger profile, hindering survival by not allowing particularly good hiding or movement. During the actual period of the wings evolution, they would be totally useless.
