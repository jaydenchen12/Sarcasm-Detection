You mean just like the continually debunked lie of "95% of all weapons found in Mexico came from America"? The lie that not even the ATF will stand behind? The lie that was purported based on successful traces of the minute number of weapons Mexico turned over to be traced and identified, while keeping the vast majority from law enforcement?
