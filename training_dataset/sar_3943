do you have any idea what kind of **** the us backed in the 50s to 80s? oh wait, you have no understanding of history in any way shape or form.  look up us involvement in the begium congo. the us help support a regime that butchered men, women and children because they wouldn't work essentially as slaves.  during that time period, the us was one of the major backs of terrorism. our hands are no cleaner then their's are.
