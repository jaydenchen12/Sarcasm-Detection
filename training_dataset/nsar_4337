well, my views are probably shaded by my anger of religion, after being under its influence for all of my childhood and a better part of my adult life.  i'm going to get on board my pontoon boat on this beautiful 70 degree autumn day and float out on the lake and ponder. maybe a more reasoned perspective can be found at the lapping of the waves below and in the intense blue sky above.
