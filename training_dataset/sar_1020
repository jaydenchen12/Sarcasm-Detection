I don't think I've ever heard of a church that reinstated a minister after he admitted he was gay. Even upon a 'repentance'. Have you? A lot of Christians view homosexuality as a lot worse and darker sin than the Bible makes it out to be--they take that and it colors their view of a gay person as a person, which is taking it too far. Gay people are right when they say that things like divorce are a lot more prevalent of a problem; I think churches need to cool it some on the homosexuality thing and simply work on showing the love of Christ.
