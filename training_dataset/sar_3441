who's crying? not i. i'm just putting people on notice. your animations are indicative of your inability to come up with a clear concise argument. you resort to false mimicry.  nothing in this thread points to a general dislike of change on my part. it's not my country. it is a country founded by godly men with a clear recognition of our creator and lord. read this and any other posts of mine and you will not find where i give a rat's xxx whether you love god. that is your business. i don't where anyone has characterized the atheists as mean and nasty. i don't recall complaining of being picked on. i simply put out a statement.. not nearly as pitiful as your attempt to make some profound statement.
