not all reform jews are liberals either. i know more than a few conservative reform jews. also there are fundamentalists of every christian denomination, i've even spoken to people who've encountered fundamentalist anglicans. :p orthodox judaism, as i understand it, attempts to perpetuate the same system of law as was delivered by moses, and more specifically the associated traditions of the last 3-4 millnenia. fundamentalist protestantism, meanwhile, sets itself against the christian tradition, such as the priesthood, apostolic succession, the doctrine of transubstantiation, infant baptism. the point i'm making is the rejection of these doctrines does not make the fundamentalist protestant churches any less christian, nor is the rejection necessarily incorrect, and the same principle applies to reform judaism. that is the comparison i was making.
