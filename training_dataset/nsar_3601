current us policy is moving towards a 27.5% tariff on all chinese products. with the exception of a few, inefficient but politically protected industries, the us produces few of the consumer goods we now import from china. what we do manufacture is so out of line with labor/compliance costs to be totally uncompetitive even if the chinese doubled their prices. does anyone think the us public, with stagnated wages, understands that move will be a substantial direct increase in their cost of living? is the administration counting on blind patriotism for public approval of again having their wallets lifted? or, does anyone else see this as a move to increase consumer spending in an effort to keep expanding the internal transaction driven gdp? as in the net difference from wholesale to retail price, our usual crisis management style in lieu of long-range planning.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050526/...us_china_trade
