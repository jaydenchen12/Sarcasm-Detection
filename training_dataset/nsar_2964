I enjoy Botany more than most things and I have heard of a couple of Botanical Experiments that involve; *1. pressurizing a plant stem with CO2 and *2. bringing in outside sun light through fiber optic cable for the plant. It brings in the full spectrum light in high lumens, but, because it's glass - it blocks harmful rays. Does anyone here have knowledge of where I might acquire the supplies necessary to conduct such experiments?
