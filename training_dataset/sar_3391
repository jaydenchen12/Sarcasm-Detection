aren't you all up in arms :p if you don't want to answer the question (say because you think it's sarcastic rhetoric) don't answer it, the fact that you responded without apparently any intention of answering or discussion tells me this is just another one of those times where you're mad but helpless. let me guess, you are going to come back with some brilliant attack on my character, save yourself the trouble; i don't want to talk about my character you can have the last word if you want but if you post in response to this i will consider it connected to the string in which my question was asked and i will simply ask you to answer it again.
