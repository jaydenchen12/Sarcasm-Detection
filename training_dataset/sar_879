It's more than likely the Trinity that's referenced in Genesis 1:26, etc. That's the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit for those of you who live in Yorba Linda.You're the spiritual dwarf who's confused. Perhaps you should humble yourself and get some Godly wisdomPartly right. The dinosaurs were long dead before the flood. Your latest reach, however - that the Bible stole the flood account from another culture is another one of your unfounded liberal myths. It's more probable that the other culture(s) stole it from the descendants of Noah in the first place.As for Xcaliber's Tourette Syndrome rant about having to go to Australia to pick up Koala bears, God doesn't need to do that. It's Biblically-based in Acts 8:39 that he can just "translate" the animals from Australia to the Middle East. That's assuming the flood involved Australia in the first place.
