Any novel change/mutation in "expression" at the organismic level that cannot be directly linked to a novel genetic mutation can only be EAM, aka Devo-Evo, (that is, developmental evolution), a neo-lamarkian phenomenon. Why? Because such a phenomenon nothing whatsoever to do with the darwinist, "ToE", that is, that such novel trait changes/'expressions' originate from-- "Random Genetic Mutation", coincidentally expressed as some lucky organismic trait that "Natural Selection" does not eliminate before it is inherited by offspring. And there simply is no genetic mutation here. What it does show, empirically, are that organismic tyraits are not determined by genetic chemicals, but by the organism's usage of those chemicals to its own purposes and advantage.
