I'd love to hear how some of these anti-theists would explain how to square wiping out all evil (decisions with negative consequences) while leaving people freedom of choice. You don't want to be mindless robot, eh? 'Course not. But don't blame God for all the evil in the world when you know one (evil) can't exist without the other (freedom).
