i'm not particularly shocked, nor worried, that the article shows that a particular group is seeking to merge government policy with their ideology. oh my, big shocker there. that is the nature of democracy.the truth is that everyone does this, not just people who happen to be religious. in fact, when you say 'these people need to be stopped,' you are seeking to have your ideology implemented on society. the problem here is inconsistency in that you seem to think it ok for you to merge your ideology and social policy, but it is not ok for other people to do so.
