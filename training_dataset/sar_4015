It is entirely premature to be discussing this matter for the purpose of promoting political positions and beliefs. It is also disrespectful to those that died and their families to try and capitalize on their pain for a political agenda.

The simple fact that authorities were able to apprehend the individual before he could commit suicide places us as a whole in a unique situation.
