Atheist answer: its relgious PEOPLE that expect us to believe in God. God himself doesn't have any kind of expectations. Theist answer: the bible says that without faith its impossible to please God, and since the bible also says that the bible is God's true word, then we only need faith to believe the bible and by extension to believe in God.
