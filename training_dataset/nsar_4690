Sorry, I expanded my definitions here and was not polite enough to inform the rest of you :) I was not meaning to say JUST that nothing would be done about global warming (though I see now that it certainly appears that way). I am saying nothing will be done PERIOD. No preparation, nothing. We will wait until it is too late, act surprised when it happens, and then blame either the mexicans or the chinese. It is what we do.
