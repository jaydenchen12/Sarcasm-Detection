blah, blah, blah is right. Thanks for the meaningless tripe. I realize you want to believe that evolution is fact but you yourself admit it's only a theory and a false and fraudulent one at that. You evos repeat the same incoherent wishful thinking as you contradict yourselves from one example to the next. People who can believe such inconsistency in science must truly prefer ignorance to enlightenment. So enjoy your ignorance but don't expect me to stop asking the questions that expose how unreasonable and impossible this fraudulent science is. And wouldn't it be great that rather than giving the same old canned responses that are based in the same old false assumptions, and the mocking insults toward me, that your side actually dealt with the questions asked. Only them, with objective and serious consideration will you evos realize how you have been duped by scientific gibberish and pseudo intellectual psycho babble that lead very simple people into thinking that with such big words and so scientific a vocabulary, the lie of evo must be at least based in truth. I submit to you that nothing could be further from the truth.
