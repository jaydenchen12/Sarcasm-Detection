this doesnt really add up to anything more than your musings so i will take up one point. respect for your mother and father is only relevant in a society where the nuclear family is the norm. there have been some societies where this was not the norm. im afraid to say this demonstrates another example of someone that believes the world is and always was as he lives it . respect( or fear) is necessary for a functioning society but not necessarily towards parents..which is exactly what the commandment orders.
