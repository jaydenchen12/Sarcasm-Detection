i don't keep track of who is who, but whoever is pushing for hate crime laws that establish gays as a protected group with special legal rights. on the other hand there are some groups pushing only for equal rights, e.g. in marriage and in the abolition of discriminatory laws. utterly irrelevant. i have no interest in groups 'classifiying equal rights as special rights', i'm talking about some demanding special rights, others equal. again, utterly pointless. i believe in equal rights for all people. not one set of rights for whites, one for blacks, one for women, one for men, one for gays, one for straights. that apparently means i hate gays. take a look at this garbage: http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/cou...e-homosexuals/
