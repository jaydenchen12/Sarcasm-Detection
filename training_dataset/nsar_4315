yes, it would be like teaching children...which doesn't seem to be that much of a problem. fair enough if they had to work it out for themsleves, in which case you would probably find that exactly the same thing we have now would have happened, but why not make it clear form the start. our forefather's weren't more stupid than us, they just hadn't discovered as much, but if they had god to dictate the history of what happened why both with all the parables. or have i got the wrong end of the stick and you think that we are discovering things closer to the truth and the stories are just a primative culture trying to work out how the world is as it is.
