NO!What we need to do is out terrorize the terrorists!Using a plethora of dispicable methods born out of the heart of madness, I'm sure we could show the world that we're number 1 in anything we set our hearts to.Why, I'd speculate that such a campaign would quickly see Osama handed over on a silver platter in short notice.Now, some might say that such would only increase opposition to the US...but, when you consider that the heads of all military aged males adorn poles leading from Kabul to Baghdad (think about it)...I'd doubt there'd be many left to take up arms.
