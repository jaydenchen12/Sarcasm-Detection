Funny how the truth so often tends to have an anti-Christian bias.If you can find something untrue in the article, point it out and proffer your evidence; otherwise... I didn't think posters were required to "balance" their opinions here.At least now we see what passes for "moderation" on this board. (That's right, folks: you can't put JPS on your ignore lists, 'cuz he's a "moderator." You know, like Glen Beck on "fair and balanced" Fox News.)
