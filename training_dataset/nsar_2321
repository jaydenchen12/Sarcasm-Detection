Any two adults can run the household, one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated, one inherits when the other dies, etc etc. That parallel does not carry over to group marriages. When one dies, who inherits? If one is incapacitied, who decides what the treatment should be? Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious. If we're talking about legal recognition, and we are (right?), then the cases are wildly different. Our marriage laws, for better or worse, are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household. They also assume man and wife, true, but don't actually depend on that. But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws; changing that is a huge project.
