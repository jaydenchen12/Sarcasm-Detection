"Hi it's me" wrote:"Dr. Phillip Johnson has been called 'our age's clearest thinker on evolution' and the 'principal lay critic of Darwinism.' He is the author of Darwin on Trial, Reason in the Balance, Defeating Darwinism by Opening Minds, and Objections Sustained."He was obviously called that by fellow creationists. I also note that he wrote plenty of books. I didn't realize that there was that much to cover. How much can you write about a topic you don't understand or try to misinterpret?Walking-fish:I love it when creationists/IDers quote Phillip Johnson, but I hate the fact that he has my first name. Lawyers make excellent sophists, being able to support both sides of an argument with equal effectiveness. They can expound forever about topics they are totally ignorant about. And this is what makes Mr Johnson such a valuable resource for the creationist movement.
