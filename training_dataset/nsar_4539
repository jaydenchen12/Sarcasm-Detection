again you're missing the historical context just as timothy mcveigh did. locke was an english philosopher who died in 1704 so he wasn't involved in writing the constitution. did you know that jefferson was an advocate of racial segregation? 'nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them.' -thomas jefferson so if jefferson could be wrong about that then he could be wrong about this too. furthermore, as i already pointed out, other founding fathers opposed him on the matter.
