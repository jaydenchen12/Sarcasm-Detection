That's a stretch you don't need to make though.Not even considering the fact that the bible contradicts itself..i.e. god performs miracles, speaks to people, etc... .. it's the definition that god is supernatural that in itself, cannot be reconciled with god "appearing". The same goes for any diety, or imaginary thing, if by definition they are imaginary/supernatural. Once you "find" something supernatural, they are no longer imaginary or supernatural, thus, you can never find them, they can only exist, by definition, without evidence, with faith. It's relativity in action yet again :)The contradiction you illustrate stands apart from the bible.-Mach
