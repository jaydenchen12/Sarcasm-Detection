Of course the problem here, is there is not enough time to go from Neanderthal morphology to "modern" morphology by way of RMNS. This is why science needs the Neanderthals be a different species and to go extinct, leaving no trace behind. But if modern humans descended from Neanderthals, darwinists will have to admit that the transformation happened nearly instantly.
