Your analysis might be correct, although I don't think I'd bet big money on it. In particular, I'm not sure about your conclusion here:"The legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken."My reading is simply that if they don't reach a conclustion in one session, they have to take it up again in the next one. If it's going to pass, it has to pass in two consecutive years, so simply taking it up in year three and saying, "Didn't pass in two consecutive years, failed" may be legit.
