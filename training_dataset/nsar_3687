you cannot mandate biology. the fact of the matter is, however, that homosexual relationships, themselves, appear to have no positive evolutionary purpose. without effects on the female line, this aberration (for lack of a better word) would have bred itself out of the population long ago. it would be similar to a subset of the population in an animal species suddenly being attracted to another, separate animal species. it would seem to serve no positive purpose. procreation is a positive, useful purpose to any activity in an evolutionary context. sexual attraction exists to facilitate procreation. pleasure during sex exists to facilitate procreation. homosexual individuals have brains that co-opt specific biological functions to substitute creatures that do not facilitate the purpose they evolved to involve.
