Evolutionists have constructed the Geologic Column in order to illustrate the supposed progression of "primitive" life forms to "more complex" systems we observe today. Yet, since only a small percentage of the earth's surface obeys even a portion of the geologic column, the claim of their having taken place to form a period of rock--life--time over the earth is therefore fantastic and imaginative thinking.
