** nonsense. that may be what you suppose exterrestrial life to be like, and as you are a materialist/mechanist, i'm not surprised to hear you say it. but i demand to see all of the intrinsic life functions that are in my posted definition, included within a complex, self-aware, self-organizing, self-supporting, self-serving system, before i confuse any artefact with a genuinely live organism. ** i wouldn't bet the farm on that, but even if true, it's the functions and what enables those functions that counts, not the construction material involved. ** energy, mass. inertia, and all of the four material forces are no more empirically observable than the life force, but you can infer them from their observed effects upon corporeal matter; just as you can observe the effects of the life force upon corporeal matter. deny life and you can deny gravity by the exact same token. but you do so at peril of making a fool of yourself. ** only upon a cursory examination that is unjustifiably satisfied with appearance. sort of like thinking that a carney magician really can work miracles, or getting fooled by movie effects. only worse.  ** only obliquely, as all of the artefacts of true living things do. in that sense, 'life' had a real effect upon it, since life created and maintains it for life's (i.e., its creator's) purposes. ** that, too. ** what you materialist/mechanists always fail to understand is that 'chemical interactions' are merely observed facts. they do not explain anything, including themselves. what they really do, is to require explaining themselves. ** nothing at all, provided you do not reduce the whole of reality, and its contents, to bits of stuff that get moved in space from one point to another, and on and on. oops!! that's materialist/mechanist ontology in a nutshell, and so that's exactly what you do believe!! ** there is none, because it isn't. check the definition of 'life'. your little toy doesn't fit it any better than a child's 'wets itself' doll 'appears' to have a functioning metabolic system. let's get real from now on, shall we?
