"If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life." - Ex 20:22-23this suggests that when an abortion occurs, the one responsible will be punished, but not by death unless the woman is killed. even the bibles says that the mother's life is more important than the fetus.
