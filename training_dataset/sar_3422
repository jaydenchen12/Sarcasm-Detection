the admin wisely deleted the link. it was a foolish thing to do. not only that, you don't know how that might come back on the owner of this forum. let's say something did happen and they find out it was because of this forum. next thing you know a free forum owner has a lawsuit on his hands. probably not gonna win it but you still have to deal with that.  rule number 1: 1. do not give your name or any personal information that could be used to identify you. do not request personal information, including age. you're not five, act like it.
