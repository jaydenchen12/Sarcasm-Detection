you misunderstand me.  i'm saying you do not speak for me. or any gay man. you are not for freedom. you are for boosting your own ego. and that, i cannot abide. as for his 'homophobia', why should i care? for all i know, he could be trolling. all i did was say his statements actually have some validity. it's not the majority of gays who do it, but still, there are sick people out there. hetero and homo alike.
