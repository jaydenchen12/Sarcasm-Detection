you behave as if i have to demonstrate that no ider has ever tried to use ic to support id. i do not and i have made no claims that one could not. 'the two points within the video do actually disprove what you said. you said that ic cannot be used to support id. when in fact, the video states very clearly that id/creationists use the argument of ic to support their 'theory.' (the two points being cases where the video indicates that iders try to use ic to prove id) all i said is that they cannot. so i ask you again can one support id with ic? youtube - fallacy of id and creationism-false dichotomy [reloaded]
