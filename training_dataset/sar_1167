That's not what I said. You're misrepresenting what I said (which is dishonest on your part) and then basically accusing me of not having honesty in your next sentence ...Why is it dishonest to want marriage and govt. separated? I've told you my stance--that's what it is. I think the real problem is that you just enjoy being belligerent and doing things like calling people "weasel" and "dishonest" when you yourself misrepresent like you did above. I have a better idea--drop the sniveling "you're-a-weasel" playground name-calling antics and start stepping up to the plate and debate the issues. If you think my stance is not a good one for the country, give some reasons. So far all you've done is basically given the equivalent of "that-would-never-work" and that's pretty much it. That, and a bunch of play-school-type insulting.
