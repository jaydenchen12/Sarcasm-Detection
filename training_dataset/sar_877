too bad you can't show me it. 'oh trust me it's there' .. what a looser you are. what a liar you are. you make a physical claim, and all you need is one little photograph, and you can't provide it. whine whine whine. what a loser you are. next then you know, you will quote from the bible to make you feel better, but it won't stop you from being a loser.
