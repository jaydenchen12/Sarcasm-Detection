so what is the bible then? simply a nice story-book for you to read from? if genesis is simply a representative story from which we can interpret the actions of god to mean natural selection and evolution, what about the ten commandments? it always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of genesis or the arc, but god really does hate the homosexuals. it says so in leveticus, right? so it must be word perfect truth... this bit about the origins of the earth? oh, we just interpret that as god designing evolution. but that part about people burning in hell for eternity, that's true, right?
