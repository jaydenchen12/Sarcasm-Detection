'most of the time' is not good enough. killing animals is murdering members of other species and those same guns can be used and are used for killing humans. the same applies to guns used for target shooting. you can take them home, have them stolen and then used to commit a crime; or your son can take them to school and shoot a few dozens kids. well, i am not saying a school massacre has ever taken place in the usa or canada; don't get me wrong oswald only used his gun for hunting, didn't he?
