The difference, and I think it is a significant difference, is that Omegamon spoke of feeling the threat of potential harm. I believe that understanding the risks that are faced every day does not require being fearful of those risks. Nor does it require being stupidly fearless. We all take reasonable steps to reduce our risk of danger every day. To me, the use of a firearm to reduce risk does not seem all that reasonable. The intent of my opening post was to find out why Omegamon and others feel differently.
