Wrong again. The tooth was never formally described or published. While the discoverer may have thought it was a human tooth, it was a newspaper that reported the find as being some race of human. Actually it was after further finds were made that it was realized that the tooth wasn't human. Again, it was never claimed by science to be a race of man. No description and no publishing means that it was never presented foramlly to science.You creationaries are so cute. You have to keep pretending that this kind of thing is meaningful. It is meaningful only to reveal the integrity of creationaries and christianaries.
