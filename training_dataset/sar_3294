but they single out polygamists. this is a very disingenuous rebuttal of yours to steeeeve's point. it's like saying that we should just leave sodomy laws in place or state marriage amendments because the laws apply equally no matter what the race or creed of the gay people involved. obviously you're either completely missing steeeeve's point in using polygamists to analogize the issues here or intentionally avoiding it.
