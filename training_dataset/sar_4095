what are the choices of the so called 'pro-choice' people? to ban or not to ban abortion, and clearly they had made their choice. even to them the word 'abortion' is hard to speak for they know abortion is killing, so drop the euphemism. because i call a spade a spade that makes me a woman hater and basher? sister, sister  now, lets examine the anti-prohibition of abortion case (at least you didnt call it pro-choice). i have never said that the defenders of the right to abortion want every woman to have an abortion. so please dont put words in my mouth
