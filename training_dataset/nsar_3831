or maybe we have a mental disability? yes, it is not common to show anger when you are happy. however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth?  i always wonder if the majority is wrong? what i mean is: what if the people in the mental hospitals are mentally normal and those who are classifed as normal are not normal?  you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure. that is my problem. how do you know for sure if the emotion you choose is correct? please give an example of this sonnet?  lol we are so off topic. i don't want to spam her debate. lets continue this debate in the messaging system please.
