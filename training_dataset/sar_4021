the technology is here. we built a prototype of a weapon a while back (mil contract) that was constructed entirely from carbon composites. it is more or less the same stuff that they make the carbon barrels for the 10-22 with. i don't think they will be hot sellers, though, as they need specialised molding systems (single use) and the composites required for the stressed parts is very expensive. the prototype cost 3.4 million to build, with an estimated per unit cost, whould they ever reach production, of $347,000 each.
