The grey area is of course if they lie and say it's not religion, it's just "ethics", or "whim". In that case it may not be illegal, but if I got that in writing, that my employee was refusing to take customers based on their own person ethics or on a whim, it makes it easy to fire them since it's already established that they are being fired for reasons other than illegal reasons (race/religion/color, etc.)
