Sorry I missed your thread on that. It sounds like you are mainly concerned with health issues that could very potentially lead to the mother's death and or/complete debilitation (like paralysis), and I'd be much more open to that. But as you said, we have two extremes to choose from, and SCOTUS chose the one that doesn't take into account the woman's health for this particular procedure. I'd also add that because this is a late term procedure, if health is the reason to not take the baby to term, then caesarian delivery very well might be an option, in many cases.
