As do you. You seriously want to dictate to others that your opinions are the truth. I'm sure you find a lot of things amusing, given your warped view on things. Actually I think that what a lot of the 55-60% of the country who oppose gay marriage find, is that if they join an internet site, that they will be viciously attacked by gay marriage supporters. That's what most of you are REALLY LIKE.  There really isn't much of an anti-gay movement, except a handful of people and a few commercials. Your vilification of them is typical of most far left gay marriage supporters.
