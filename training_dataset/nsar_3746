i must say, that first paragraph you wrote really interests me. i've become so accustomed to speaking to hereditary theists that i wasn't sure it was even possible to be religious with atheist parents. if you don't mind my asking, who introduced you to christianity? or was it some sort of overnight process, as in you woke up and just believed through some some divine revelation?
