i can't protect my family from extended family interference without marriage. i can't designate who will receive my social security benifits without marriage. i can't protect my partner from having to pay 50% inheritence taxes on a property she already owns without marraige. i can't live in an assisted living center with my partner if/when that time should come, without marriage.  i can't get married to my partner in mass. and leave the area and have our marriage recognized in anyother state, without legalize federally recognized, completely 100% portable marriage!  in short, you're full of carp.  there are almost 1,100 rights, protections and priveledges that are given to 'married' couples, who almost alway take them for granted, which are flat out denied to gay/lesbian couples.
