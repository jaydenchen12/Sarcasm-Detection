If it's a well reasoned one, yes. If it's yet another attempt to denigrate those who disagree with you by making absurd generalisations, then no. The attention seeking makes little sense as I rarely discuss my personal religious experiences because they are just that, personal, and because my telling people something will not be convincing to them, and hence serves no purpose. If you want to trivialise mental illness in order to belittle others then that's entirely your lookout. If you want I could reciprocate by pointing out how obsessive-compulsive your rants are.
