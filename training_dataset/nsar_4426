I agree, but when you know your opponent will succeed in making you look weak if you give them the chance, trying to look like the bigger man will do Jack for you. I know I'm the bigger man, the only reason for publicly displaying my moral high roadedness on an Internet forum is to prove myself, but if I know my opponent will use it as leverage against me then there's really no point.
