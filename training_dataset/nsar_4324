yes, it's supposed to be a ceteris paribus problem.  okay, so people seem fairly agreed that, all else equal, less wrongful deaths are preferable to more wrongful deaths.  now what i'm curious about is eddie's third assumption, 'assumption three: two bad things is worse than 1 bad thing'.  now, it's obvious that there is a greater quantity in the number of things, but how does that quantity of things entail a lower moral quality of the outcome?
