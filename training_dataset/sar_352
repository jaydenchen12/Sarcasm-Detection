Archie,This post is like Dejavu for me chloe. Yesterday my Pastor said the same exact thing in church, and for the same reason.And so he should, if so he believes.I would like to ask your pastor how many children (s)he has adopted. Only then is (s)he qualified to speak, however.Just don't any of you try to shove that perverted view of "life" on any of the women in my family, thank you.emoticonXAngry They are perfectly capable of deciding the future of their pregnancies for themselves without any of you butting in where you don't belong.
