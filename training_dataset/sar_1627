To refute your examples of contemorary 'Christians' deciding that violence is a good thing.See, you grasp at what you like WITHOUT resorting to your own bible to support your fleshly desires. Just like Arch does.I counter that and use the scripture (which is good for the education in all things) to show what these 'believers' should have done.Now, if you want to actually study your bible and use contradictorary verses to support your stance, feel free.That'd just support the concept that the bible is self-contradicting.
