OUCH! Err... what the - OOF! OW! Aw come on... ARRGH! DOWN BOY! Hi, allow me to introduce myself. I'm UNDETERRED! I have a tenth grade education and an internet connection. A while ago when I wanted to find out if there were any creatures with both gills and lungs, I found NEOTENIC AXOLOTLS. Like I said that was a while ago, and that's the name I remember. I have a vague recollection about neotenic meaning that it didn't pass a certain life stage, and apart from that I always thought axolotls were called axolotls. In my country they are, anyway. Now I ask you, what the HELL does it matter what the HELL I called it, as long as you know what it is (or can at least you can look it up, too). TIME TO UP YOUR MEDS. emoticonXMad
