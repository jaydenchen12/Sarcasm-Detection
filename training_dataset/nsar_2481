Hate to burst your ballon, but the mayor of San Francisco had JUST been elected. He doesn't need to worry about votes for a long time.Judges are supposed to rule on the Constitutionality of laws when asked to do so. They are doing their job. If it violates the Constitution it is illegal. Plain and simple. They are not making law.
