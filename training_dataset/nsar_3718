the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. it took weeks for rescue workers to water-cool the glowing steel beneath the wreckage at ground zero. it was clearly and prominently visible in a thermal image taken by a usgs satellite on september 16--five days later. in the video, one of the workers states that it has been almost 6 weeks after the attacks, and workers are still trying to cool down the steel. the 9/11 commission and supporters of the official story don't try to make the claim that office fires produce molten steel. they just ignore it.
