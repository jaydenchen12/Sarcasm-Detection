Right....Anyway, its not surprising Americans don't read the EU constitution: I don't know any Europeans who've read the US constitution.I agree with Jo and Nurglitch, its not all that funny (although i quite like the 'veritable smorgasbord of asisininities). It seems to be 'politics first, comedy after', something comedians of all persuasions are vulnerable too: what you would call 'liberal' comedians here in Britain were often so angry about Iraq that their sketches devolved into rants.Incidentally, what does the US have against the EU constitution? Is it fear of a superstate with greater economic clout, or just 'those darnded Europeans, with their welfare'?
