I personally am astounded at the overreaction of the government in response to a handfull of shootings in NO. Sending in the army in full force, confiscating guns and talking about an 'insurgency' just because of a couple of crackpots have been firing their guns.On an average day in New York there are 10 times as many reports of shootings, yet I don't see such a massive military response over there...
