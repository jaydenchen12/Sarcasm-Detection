By what standard of evidence does evolution science claim a direct evolutionary relationship with those hominids that preceded us such as Java, Peking and Neanderthal MAN, Is it based on chromosomal, amino acids, cytochrome c, genetics, DNA, lifestyle, or simply based on their hominid/primate similarities? Now if you come back with evidence that Neanderthal buried their dead, and deduce from that a direct relationship with modern man, then surely some chemical relationship has also been discovered since the advent of DNA technology, whether it it nuclear or mitochondrial similarities/connections, or one of the other chemical relationships mentioned above.
