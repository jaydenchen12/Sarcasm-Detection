i did say that if birth control failed (condoms do sometimes too, i think their effectiveness is at like 97%, but that's not 100%) abortion should be acceptable. i know some people want to ban the morning-after pill, but i think most people agree that it should be ok, i know i do. the day of conception, there is virtually no argument that the fetus is actually a human life that takes priority over the mother's life, unless they get into a purely religious rant about how the moment of conception the fetus is a human life that deserves the same rights as anyone. anyway, i don't agree with that.
