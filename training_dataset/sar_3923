while you see the need to not only debate him on points, then post an expose about your ideas of his capability, i'm still curious why you like to discuss why a tautology is a tautology. how does the phrase 'survival of the fittest' change in any way, what evolution is, the evidence that supports it, and the fact that there simply is no strong evidence for any other mechanism by which humans have come to be, on earth? i ask because i assume you must think there is some relevance to the discussion of creation vs evolution. there might not be, that's ok too, i'd just like to make sure we don't put words in your mouth. -mach
