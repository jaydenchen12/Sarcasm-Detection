You are so right-on in what you say!In a Sunday school at a church I formerly attended, an elder of the church remarked that his "faith was strengthened" by the "evidence" afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east. In a tone I now rather regret, I blurted out two things......How weak was your faith before?and...If the "evidence" had gone 'the other way,' would your faith then have been weakened?His answer for the second question was a simple 'no,' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence' he was employing was not the same sense you'd expect a scientist to use.His response to the first was problematic, and interesting. "My faith," he said, has always been--then he used the most interesting word--"complete." But he had taken sufficient offence already, it seemed, that I pressed no further. I wish sometimes that I'd asked: If your faith was "always complete," did the archaeological evidence make it "more complete"? And, if so, does your sense of 'complete' match that word's usual application?I do not quite grasp the notion of there being "scientific evidence" for a proposition within the realm of faith. I do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint. Activity in one realm may be felt in the other.But, re: evolution, I think this...Given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'Biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms. Scientific discovery, evidence, and discourse thus don't "disprove the Bible." Rather, they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text, and give us cause--I call it: opportunity--to find new, richer meaning in scripture. I'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians' interpretations. Emphasizing the 'literal,' as some do--a very problematic term in itself--some Christians see in, for example, the Genesis "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" nothing more than a tree. A biological tree. Pear tree. Peach tree. Apple tree. Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Albeit a special species, nonetheless a species. And, for them, there you go--Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species, and that's your story. Lost, in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation, is the richness of metaphor the story offers. Metaphor, again and again, is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed, in the readings of certain Christians.Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal' interpretation. Christian faith--at least, the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor, parable, legend and myth, and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture--is equally victim. I feel more sadness about such a limited believer's faith than I do about that person's science.Master_Shake, for your poignantly apt remark--"what they have isn't faith at all"--thanks. Bless you!Brad
