humphreys is full of ####. how about you check out dalrymple's book? 100% of the scientific evidence kicks humphreys's xxx. a.k.a. 'the winding up problem.' completely fabricated, based on a complete misunderstanding of galactic motion. many don't. but they're replenished from the oort cloud regularly. science also explains this thing called plate tectonics. that humphreys 'overlooks' this should make you smell the rat. so he 'overlooks' plate tectonics twice? he's either ignorant or a liar. some might say both. knowing his other work as i do, i say both. first, it's a faulty assumption. second, the ion content of the oceans isn't changing. third, if this method worked, and we used aluminum, we could 'prove' that the earth can't be more than 300 years old. oops. talkorigins takes care of this one just fine. i'm just wondering what kind of trees grow to 2500 feet tall. never trust anybody too ignorant of plate tectonics to understand subduction to tell you about geology. ... were addressed above. you have so few arguments that you're repeating yourself, mainly because you don't even read the tripe that you post. humphreys blew the calculations big time. he's been refuted left and right. do a search on his bogus r.a.t.e. group and find out for yourself. because humphreys went out looking? how many should we allegedly find? but there's no evidence here for creation. all you can do is argue (extremely poorly) against an old earth. three strikes and your out, kid. hit the showers.
