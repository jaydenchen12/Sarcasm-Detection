oh, and btw, cooperative mechanisms of evolution are perfectly compatible with darwinian mechanisms. it's still a matter of determining which genomes survive into the next generation, and if genes that have 'learned' how to cooperate are better survivors than those that compete too aggressively, then darwinian theory predicts they should increase their frequency in the population. biologists have used game theory extensively to model how balances between cooperation and competition can be maintained in a genetic population. but what we get from this sort of perspective is not a refutation of darwinian thinking, but a more complete perspective.
