How can you say such things? The Bible says that God CREATED over and OVER and OVER again! And you reject that and say that everything came about by evolution? If you reject the literal account of the Creation in Genesis, you are saying that God is a liar! If you cannot trust God's Word from the first verse, how can you know that the rest of it can be trusted?
