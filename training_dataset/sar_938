NO, to rag on a gay activist--because of the hypocrisy. And there are certainly people here who also can't pass up the opportunity to show such hypocrisy with religious activists against gays, and I don't recall you opposing THEM on that. If you all are going to take glee in hypocrisy of religious activists against gay rights, you might as well realize that what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
