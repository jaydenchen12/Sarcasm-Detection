And it's so bleedin' unnecessary, too! Why not just create the universe as it is? And just let the light take it's sweet time to get here? Imagine what proof for creationism that would be: we can only see stars out to 6000 light years or so; looking at old star charts we realize that people 1000 years ago could only see stars out to 5000 light years; and as time goes by additional stars appear in the sky as the light from them finally reaches us. If God did create the universe only 6000 years ago, the fact that we can see the entire universe now can only count as a deliberate, I will repeat, a deliberate, oh how I love that word, DELIBERATE deception on the part of the creator.
