Apparently gay marriage is more threatening than unmarried gay couples are. The point about legalizing gay households is certainly puzzling unless one contends that cohabitation is illegal (which it isn't). But just in case I'm wrong, perhaps the authorities should be notified of all the heterosexual unmarried couples and they should be hauled off to jail.
