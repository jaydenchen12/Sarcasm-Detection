youre forgetting something cz, it's not the word of god. it's the word of 'divinely inspired men.' (sounds suspicious all ready.) who must have been stoned out of their freeken minds in order to write such an absurd fiction. its is good for only one thing, to be hung next to the sears catalog. not only is the bible fiction, its a sick, dangerous, virulent manual for the self-destruction of the human race.
