evolution may attempt to explain how life developed here, but it proves nothing which is why this debate is persistent and never-ending. and exogenesis is the evolutionists fall back explanation for that which they can't prove or justify otherwise, but leave it to the liars that your side is to attempt to attribute to us what you yourself is claiming. beside the fictional links, everything else is from pro-evolution sources and explanations for this other theory for how life appeared on earth. even dawkins has referred to it as a rational consideration for how original life appeared so many alleged billions of years ago on earth. read this link: the physics of the universe - the beginnings of life - exogenesis then read my posted info below and see if it isn't spot on based on what is being claimed in the link above. i rest my case.
