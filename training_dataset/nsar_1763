I would like to see more conclusive data on the subject but most importantly a REAL plausible solution. I'm not an expert but it does appear most scientists feel global warming is partly man-made. I do get a little sketched out when I see scientists are trying to restrict research for those that go against the theory. They may have strong arguments but that kinda BS really blows your credibility.
