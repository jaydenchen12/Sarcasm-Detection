Michael Jackson is a singing/dancing enigma that has not been equaled in the history of the US. Sammy Davis came close. Elvis was big on marketing and short on pure talent. Neither of the aforementioned are my "cup o' tea" so to speak but I must give credit where credit is due regardless.One other thing Whacko Jacko represents is the sheer possibilities afforded to each and every American citizen to succeed. Michael Jackson came into this world a poor, black, male and look at him now! A rich, white, woman!It is rumored that he arrived in court to hear the verdict wearing a pair of boys underwear tied around his right arm. The judge asked him if he was being contemptuous to the courtroom and Jackson replied, "Oh no, your honor. I'm on the patch." :p :p :p
