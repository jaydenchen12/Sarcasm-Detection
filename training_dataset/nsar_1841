Don't get me wrong. This isn't exactly a trip to Sunday school. You shouldn't accept packing an arsenal around in the trunk as if it were completely innocuous. It kinda seems suspicious like a primer colored Nissan Maxima with five guys wearing stocking caps sitting in a vacant lot at 3 a.m.........something's not right, but nothing is illegal.The guy should have been asked to leave airport property.Officer #1: "HOLY COW! GUNS! Arrest him!"Officer #2: "On, what?"Officer #1: "Uh......Felony something! Uh......Felony transportation of guns! No. Not evil sounding enough. Uh.........Felony transportation of AN ASSAULT RIFLE! Yeah! I've included the term "assault rifle" so it must be illegal!"Officer #2: "What about those guys over there in that Nissan Maxima?"Officer #1: "Oh, they look suspicious. We'll check them for legally carried firearms next. If we don't find any, I guess we'll have to let them go."
