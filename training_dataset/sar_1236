The Patriot Act was enforced for a limited duration, but is subject to continued use if it is re-enacted. I hope it isn't, and if it is that would be a great XXXX to civil liberties in the US.Concur. I worked with a person that had just come to the US from Europe; they commented that for the country that says they're the most free in the world, the US sure did have "a lot of rules for what you can't do".
