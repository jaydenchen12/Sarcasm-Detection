the only reason that it will be a mac is because of the information that is still inside of the computer that should be removed if you want to take the whole brain. you have to remember that the human mind is not just a hard drive. it is also the processor (brain) as well as the motherboard (connector of inputs and outputs) and the ram (short term memory). there is nothing else in the human body that can better fit the role of any of these four components. this is also the core of what determines if a computer is a mac or a pc. if you take all these pieces from your pc and put them in a mac then you have a pc. this is the case since you will be able to run pc-only applications and not mac-only applications.
