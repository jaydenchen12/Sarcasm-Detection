http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe....ap/index.htmlGood for the Spainards! Personally, I think U.S. conservatives have gotten too complacent these days--we need to protest like this more often. We've gotten to where we lay down too easily and let ourselves get run over too easily by immoralism. These people in Spain are showing great courage--U.S. conservatives could learn a lot from them.
