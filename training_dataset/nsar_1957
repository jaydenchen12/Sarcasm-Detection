MIRRORED POST,... it might be easiest to preserve flow later on if we don't actually mirror each of our posts once comments arrive (and inevitably digress) - just let people quote/cite us from this one if needs be. I certainly plan on adding in more off-topic commentary/digressions in the mirror thread (marked in these posts as *, when I remember to).
