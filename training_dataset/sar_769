A human life is only a person once there is someone existing there. Before a fetus has a mental existence, it is just a growing human body - a thing, not a person. A thing cannot suffer, cannot feel pain, fear or even feel anything for that matter. How can you have empathy for a thing? Once a fetus develops a mental existence, then it is a person worthy of protection, as are all people.
