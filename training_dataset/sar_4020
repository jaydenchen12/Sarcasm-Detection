i think a better question is what preserved their life for so long? it is the mercy of god that upholds and preserves people in this life. it is the sin of human beings that is responsible for death. this is not correct. god does go 'out of his way' to keep everyone alive. besides that, god would never be presented with any kind of problem, much less a problem of overpopulation. good grief, to suggest that the god who created the earth would have a problem with overpoulation is, frankly, as ridiculous as trying to find some passage in the bible that condones, allows, or supports any and every abortion that occurs. that is ridiculous.
