If I was to ask a religious person of a provable way that he found out about his belief he would have to say that he was told. If the person that told him was asked the same thing he would have to say the same answer. Now of course it can go back wards like that for ever, it has to go back to three ‰ÛÏpossible‰Û beginnings: some one lied, some one was insane/delusional/ect, or there was divine intervention/ect.
