Since posts are disappearing anyway, let me add a new one.Now we all know that I am made in the image and likeness of God and since God is perfect, that image and likeness must also be, as a logical consequence, perfect. To state less would mean that God is not perfect. So if I am the image and likeness of God, then either I am perfect or God is not.
