Then explain to me why a pregnant woman was hit by a car not long ago leading to the death of both mother and baby. Resulting in a double vehicular homicide charge being leveled against the driver ? How can that be if the unborn child doesn't have rights as a human being ? And why could the mother have aborted that baby legally if she chose to ? Isn't that a true catch 22 for the unborn, and a contradiction in the law ?
