leviticus 18:22 do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable. leviticus 20:13 if a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. they are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. i also grabbed my bible to see what its says in context and it says nothing about temple prostitution or idolatry
