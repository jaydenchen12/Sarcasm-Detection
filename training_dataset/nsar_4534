what about the fact that scientific information allways changes to suit what is observed. it isnt consistent. dont get me wrong, i am facinated with science, and agree with a lot of what it has proven, but i dont think that the bible should be discarded as a piece of fiction. after all, jesus was a real person. he did exist.
