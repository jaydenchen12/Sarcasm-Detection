Nice job moving the goalpost, and changing the subject also. Show where in BCR's post which you quoted above, he said even spoke to the issue of genes? He said no new functions have evolved in a population in which it hasn't existed before. And regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria, are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon? The bacteria works on a microscopic level and couldn't care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on. So your example is both fallacious and moot.
