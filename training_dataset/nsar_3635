no you didn't, here's what you posted - what am i to infer or understand based on the underlined? it says 'ice lay beneath the surface'???????? what surface? the surface now? the surface 65 million years ago? are you still trying to assert that the ice from 65 million years ago should somehow be present today? how am i supposed to get 'surface as below the surface ice that is 2000-4000 years old' from that? type what you mean clearly arch, we can't interpret your convoluted thinking. are you asking about the land under the ice which they are now coring? google 'arctic geology' 'antarctic geology' or 'greenland geology' for the answers to that. what does this have to do with anything?  i'm completely lost. maybe it's me. waxy
