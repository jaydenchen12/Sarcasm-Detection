That's true, as long as ones pursuit of science is really science. In the case of "creation science," there is no science involved. As trebor has said, "creation science" is an attempt to find scientific sounding reasons that can be used to justify the conclusions that have already been reached and that are not subject to change. That's how "creation science" works. Begin with the conclusion and then search for scientific sounding justification.Real science is a process and a way of learning.
