the problem with atheism is that man is material just like a rock. concepts do not exist in a rock whey should they exist in man? we are all matter. you can say we are more conplex than a rock, but that does not make a difference; matter can not accout for concepts. yes, www.carm.org is awsome thats an example of ad hominim - attacking the individual instead of the argument
