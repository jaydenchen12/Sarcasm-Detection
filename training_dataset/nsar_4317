walking around naked endangers my right to innocent thought. watching little girls in the bathroom endangers their right to privacy. gay marriage does not affect anyone other than those getting married. if you could effectively prove that two homosexuals marrying each other would harm me physically or mentally, (and thus taking away my rights as a citizen), i would say you have a point. also, along the lines of what mach said, no one has the right to walk around naked. the law applies equally. same with looking at little girls naked. no one has that right. however, everyone except homosexuals have the right to marry whomever (not whatever) they please. only homosexuals are told they cannot marry other homosexuals.
