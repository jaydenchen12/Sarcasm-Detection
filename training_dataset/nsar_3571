i do believe that the predictions are accurate, but i say 'no' for two reasons: one, stopping the event would create a paradox. since the event is stopped, it never happens. if it never happened, then nostradamus never predicted it. the second reason is, in the prediction that correlated to 9-11, skeptics asked why they couldn't stop the incendent. along with point one, i say to them 'how do you know that somebody didn't go to authorities on 9-10-01, and say 'there's gonna be a terrorist attack tomorrow''? if someone cited a cryptic writing dating back centuries as evidence, they would either be laughed at and dismissed, or sent to a mental hospital. edit: sorry about forgetting the poll. i remembered that just as i hit the submit button. i'm half asleep today.
