And I'll bet the formal list of "great physicists" who preceded the development of the theory of evolution is meaningful. I wonder how many of these "great physicists" also believed that night air could make them ill? How many beleived in alchemy, like Newton? I wonder if Newton is in that list? He didn't believe in the divinity of Christ.
