The proof is in the pudding.. I suggest that you read my post again and let me know if you disagree with any of my opinions. If not, then you have to come to the conclusion that God does not exsist... God's only exsistance in the minds of believers just as was the case with believers of different Gods throughout human history. I do not understand what you are referring to when you said, "just admit you are a faith based preacher, as bad as any fundamentalist"? By the way it should be ovious that I am an atheist.
