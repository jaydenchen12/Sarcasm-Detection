this is what i don't understand. on the one hand we have iranians going on about death to america. on the other our own president is constantly making statements about spreading democracy and toppling current regimes in the me. is one any worse than the other?  i still contend that mad solves most of the problems with nuclear proliferation. sure, some of the iranians are crazy (as are some american leaders), but they are not stupid. they are not going to use nukes as offensive weapons if it is going to ensure their own destruction in retaliation.
