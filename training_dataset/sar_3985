you're full of it. go back and reread my posts, including the one with biblical verses. and, to put an exclamation point on jesus and the constitution, it was dated in 'the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven.' that's right. not the lord, but our lord! there he is - jesus in the constitution!!! chew on that, o flatulent one!
