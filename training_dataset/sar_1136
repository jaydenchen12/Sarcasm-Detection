People who own weapons aren't responsible for combating or preventing crime in general. Gun ownership doesn't commit us to becoming default cops. What ownership does is allow us to protect ourselves in the event of an armed criminal attack. So the basis for your articles thesis is fallacious in expecting armed people to somehow become extensions of law enforcement in order to justify being armed.Therefore, the only rational response to your premise is to encourage more law abiding people to be armed and trained so as to outnumber the armed criminals so they will have no unarmed citizens to victimize. That is the most effective way to intimidate the lawless criminals into never using their weapons for violence for fear that their intended victim may actually be better armed then they are.
