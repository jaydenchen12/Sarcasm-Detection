i did comment by saying that it's all the more reason to make civil unions legal nationwide, with couples' benefits.  regarding your frustration with analogies, analogy is a common tool in discussion and debate. if you don't like analogies, i will be sure and point that out the next time a gay lobbyist here uses one, such as comparing gay marriage to interracial marriage (such as when invoking the loving case).
