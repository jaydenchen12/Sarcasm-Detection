now orion, there you go trying to bash someone else's religion when you still have not been able to document who your god is, where it lives, and be able to substantiate your beliefs with anything other than a feel-good whim. you have created your own god - a liberal's god who approves of gay sex, shacking up, fornication, worshiping satan and baal (i.e. your 'all paths lead to heaven here, frank), etc., etc.  you've got no credibility around here until you come out of the closet with your 'god'. then you can run with the big dogs.
