where are those who hate all christians that are members of congregations led by those radical preachers that abhor homosexualality?  why have they not spoken out against this hatred of white people espoused by obama's mentor and spiritual advisor? why is obama still a member of a hate-driven church? can you support a first lady that was not proud of the united states until her husband went to the top? do you suppose she hates white people like her pastor seems to? what connection does the obama campaign have with the black panther party? it appears to me that the democrats will soon have a chance to elect a real monster...no matter which one they decide to promote.
