i don't think that killing people as a form of punishment is setting a very good example to the rest of the world - if the public start to see authorities giving people death penalties, everybody will just think that killing is ok and it will be a vicious circle! the best way to get through to people, i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.
