my college room-mate is southern and i love her to death. coddle around hunter all you want. he tried to demonize an entire musical genre (that he probably does not listen to and knows nothing about) - and well, music is my blood, so that ticks me off. secondly - he is not only racist - in other posts he has proven himself quite a bit sexist. quite threatened by women who have dreams bigger than washing his underwear this one. i am a woman - so that is strike, too. as a music, loving woman of a non-white child - this guy offends me on many personal levels. he feels no call to be pc - and neither do i.
