i would not be concerned considering the source - newsmax is a notoriously right-wing site that is hardly considered a reliable source.they are about as reliable as the john mccain campaign or fox news(hee hee). newsmax has a list of false claims. and quite personally, most of the claims seem kinda wacko - way out there. send it into factcheck or something.
