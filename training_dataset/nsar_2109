5) Show me one instance of an evolutionist (any book, any website) admitting that ‰ÛÏevolution‰Û may not be evolution at all, but simply an individual organism's ability to utilize his genetic diversity and adapt himself to his local environment ‰ÛÒ that selection may not have anything to do with phenotypic change....and instead of vertically, evolution first happens horizontally. (A trait of a good scientist is to consider opposing viewpoints and alternatives, not to ignore them.)
