Yeah! The NRA is just encouraging a Wild West shootouts in our streets! Yeah, that stupid NRA! So I thought I would take a look at the records. This is ALL justifiable homicides and not just concealed carry permit holders, from 1996 to the last date of records on the FBI website 2007. So according to the Anti-gun side, we should see a humongous progression of citizen killings of innocent citizens, or in other words, criminals, as the number of Concealed Carry states pass their laws and allow permit holders carry concealed handguns. No? From Expanded Homicide Data Table 14 - Crime in the United States 2005 and http://www.fbi.gov/filelink.html?fil.../00tbl2-17.xls and   Justifiable Homicide by Weapon, Private Citizen,1 2003-2007 Oooops! emoticonXIcSo lets look at Law enforcement just for comparison of the normal fluctuation in the number of incidents! From http://www.fbi.gov/filelink.html?fil.../00tbl2-16.xls and Expanded Homicide Data Table 13 - Crime in the United States 2005 and   Justifiable Homicide by Weapon, Law Enforcement,1 2003-2007 Oooops again!Like always, just bloated hype from the Anti-Constitutionalists! Nothing more!
