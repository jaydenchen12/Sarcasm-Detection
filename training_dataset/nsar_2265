Diseases used to be ascribed to God and it was thought that those people who got sick deserved to be sick because of their lack of piety. Now we know that diseases strike indiscriminately (where piety is concerned) and affect people only based on their risk of acquiring the virus and their general state of health. There are many other examples.
