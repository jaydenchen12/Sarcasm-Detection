The only gun control laws that I really support are the laws stating that you may not carry a gun in certain places. While yes, this may affect law abiding citizens by not allowing them to carry their guns with them, criminals and terrorists are not allowed to carry them either. It is not meant to take your rights away, it is meant to prevent guns from being introduced into areas where they are deamed to be dangerous and innapropriate, ie schools and airplanes.
