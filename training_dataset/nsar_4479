do you think that english is in some way uniquely suited to the pursuit of science? there is a pretty long history of science in india. i'm not an expert on pre-colonial india but i'm pretty certain it was not the primitive land you seem to think it was. western science could have been obtained by other sources than colonisation. japan is an alternative example of how trade with the west might have occured.
