What's your definition of pure?Has it?This says different: http://skepdic.com/homeo.htmlI do know of recent studies that show that minute amounts of toxic substances are beneficial and therapeutic. I don't know if one can consider this homeopathic medicine though.I guess I don't know what's being called homeopathic medicine these days.If someone comes up with something that works can they just call it homeopathic medicine and say that homeopathic medicine works?
