For me the reason I don't "give it credit" is that it's irrelevant--I don't see how it matter either way way if sexual "orientation" is natural or not. It's a separate issue from the moral one.Remember, it's natural for animals to do many things--some species' males impregnate the females and leave forever the female to raise the offsrping on it's own. But just because such behavior exists among animals doesn't make it moral in humans. In fact I'd call it immoral. There are many such examples in the animal kingdom.Natural doesn't mean it's automatically moral.
