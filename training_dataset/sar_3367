the benefits aspect can be resolved simply by petitioning the government to stop using the word marriage and substitute in its place the word civil union and allow any couple (of age of consent) to join in a civil union. right . . . but rather than removing every reference to marriage from every state and federal law and replacing it with the words 'civil union' and then extending the right to participate in a civil union to gay people and straight people alike, wouldn't it be way easier just to, uh, let gay people get married? besides, if the idea of gay marriage is seen as an 'attack' on straight marriage, how exactly is the notion of removing 'marriage' altogether going to be construed? not as a friendly compromise, i'm betting.
