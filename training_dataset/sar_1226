abortion is all fine and dandy to you until it comes down to your own life.... obviously because you reacted in such a way...The point being... "mental eistence" is relative if we take your view.So what youre saying is an embryo that has survived an abortion because they couldnt kill it all the way still has no mental existance?? i would say that those people are glad to be alive and im sure some of those aborted babies would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you dont think they should live..
