A few blocks from my house there is a group of stores with some offices on the second floors. Apparently there is a Planned Parenthood office in the complex because a group of anti-abortion protestors were there the other day. I didn't know that before then. I wondered what they hoped to accomplish by their protest so I asked them. One woman said she hoped to discourage women from considering abortion. I didn't think of it at the time, but Planned Parenthood does a lot more than abortion services. I wonder if the protests might also dissuade a young woman who was seeking contraceptive services from going into that office as well. If this were the case, the abortion protests would accomplish the opposite of their goal. They potentially could have increased the chances of an unwanted pregnancy by discouraging contraceptive use. In turn, this might increase the chances of an abortion. I wonder if anti-abortion folks ever consider that?
