NOTE: When I say beneficial mutations, I am not talking about a gain of new genetic information to the genome. The organism can survive in the environment by a loss of genetic information i.e. the loss of a function, for example the loss of wings of a beatle on a windy island helps it to survive. If they had wings, they may be blown into the ocean and drown. Over time, you may get a population of wingless beatles - the adaption would be mutation by natural selection. Not evolution. Which also fits beautifully with the creation account.
