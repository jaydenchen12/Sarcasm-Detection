well, since we don't have to treat people equally, i see nothing wrong with making all people ages 14-16 slaves. (i doubt anyone will be against this anyway.) but moreover, since we are not equal, we can make women have pregnancies and disallow abortion. right? now obviously i think everyone is equal. personally i don't see someone that makes 1million a year any different then someone that is homeless. i guess this explains the devaluing of like though :(
