I can understand your point that, in the absolute, metaphysical sense, we can never be 100.00% sure of any of our knowledge. Just because all humans always have experienced the existence of the world, doesn't mean that it is 100.00% certain, just that the probability that it is true approaches 100.00% (say, 99.9999999%). The greater the amount of evidence, the closer that certainty is to 100.00%. That 0.0000001% leaves room for obsurd scenarios - such as that an omnicient being is causing us all to merely imagine our reality, or the scenario of the movie "The Matrix". These can be fun to ponder (especially in a social situation after a few drinks ;) ), but no one takes them seriously. If anyone did seriously live by the idea that the world may not exist, they would quickly do something stupid and die, or change their minds.
