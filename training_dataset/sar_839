so by your various definitions, left-handedness makes that person a deviant. most of america is right handed (so it would be considered the norm), left-handed people function different than right handed people as well as behave differently in the way the go about their lives. are left handed people wrong and unnatural as well? no one has determined why people are left-handed, and whether it is caused by genetics or early environmental stimuli. they are deviating from the norm. did you know that the word sinister is derived from the old english meaning 'left handed' due to old beliefs about left-handedness? do you actually (by your previous arguments) believe that left-handedness is wrong? if you don't, then you cannot possibly apply your arguments to homosexuality. if you do, i'm sorry, but you are ignorant.
