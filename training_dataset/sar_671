For someone to whine offense and "trolling" in this thread authored by this "troll" and for the same someone to have posted 13 times in this "trolling" thread demonstrates the height of hypocrisy, a vice so earnestly and 'piously' practiced by the religous.In a way I guess your DOCUMENTED hypocrisy x 13 reinforces the contention of my thread: that conditional christian love is hypocrisy and false. Thank you
