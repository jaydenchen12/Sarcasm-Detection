* There is abundant evidence that many of the rock strata were laid down quickly, one after the other, without significant time breaks between them. For example, preservation of ripple marks requires rapid burial, as in the Flood (e.g. lower Triassic rock, England). Folding of sedimentary rock without cracking or heating, such as at Eastern Beach, Auckland, New Zealand, suggests the folding occurred before the sand and mud had time to turn into stone, consistent with rapid deposition during the Flood.
