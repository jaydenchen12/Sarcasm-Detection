First Paragraph:"christianity is living a lifstyle patterned after the teachings, actions and philosophies of christ."Sure, not a bad definition."in order to do this, you must accept that the records of christ's life are fact."Every single word in the gospels? No, not at all. Remember, the works which became the new testament were around for centuries before they were actually compiled into the Bible. And none of the originals still exist. Who knows what changes were made to the account of Jesus's life before they were finally compiled. For example, look at Matthew 10:34 "Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword." Doesn't sound much like Jesus, does it? It certainly doesn't fit into the picture that's generally painted of Jesus. In the end the New Testament was written and compiled by mistake prone people. Some may believe that it's the unadulterated word of God, but looking at the above passage it's also easy to believe that it's also the work of common people.The rest of the paragraph rather depends on accepting that line, and I believe I've shown that a reasonable person might not, so I'm going to skip to your next paragraph.
