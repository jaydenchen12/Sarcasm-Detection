given the following:  -there is no evidence for the existence of god. -there is no evidence against the existence of god. due to the fact that there are an infinite number of false premises, and only a limited number of true premises, it is better to err on the side of skepticism. this is why the burden of proof rests on the believers. until such time this burden of proof is satisfied, the logical position is the position of skepticism. i cannot say with absolute certainty that god does not exist, but i will live my life as if that were the case until proven otherwise.
