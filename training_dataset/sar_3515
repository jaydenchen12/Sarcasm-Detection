interesting and so revealing, you are so twisted in your thinking that you equate amoral liberals/socialists as real americans while considering traditionalists like me as less than 'real american'? your sides anti american sentiments are why this country is spiraling into a moral and fiscal decline that we may be too late to salvage for the next generation.  as for making calls and driving your 5 liberals to vote early, if this is even true, sorry, but it's too little to late. the 'real americans' have rejected your messiah's gospel of marxism and will vote out all of the liars who supported his marxist agenda. now bend over and take it like a man because we are on the eve of your reality check. emoticonxbouncer emoticonxagree
