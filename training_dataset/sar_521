Happygrl35, the premise from the man's perspective is the same arguement pro-choicers argue, all they are doing is legally terminating a mass of tissue, not a human being. According to pro-choicers, life isn't conceived at conception, so if I man after having sex with a woman and the woman becomes pregnant, she is not pregnant with a baby, she is pregnant with a cell that can "develop" into a baby. If a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the development of a human being, then he too like the woman already has, should have the opt-out option. A woman can do with her body what she so chooses, like she does, however, everyone including women must mitigate their own damages. If a woman who is pregnant with a few "cell clusters" and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being, she is allowed to do so, but she caused the development of a human baby not the man, and should be solely liable for such creation. Remember, when the man left after having sex, he did not create a human being according to pro-choicers, if at most he created a "cell". According to pro-choicers, cells do not translate into a human life. A male should have an opt-out period just like the woman, before the cells become a HUMAN BEING.emoticonXHoho God, I love it. Pro-choicers don't even want to live by their own words. I'm trying to understand their position. Its a "cluster of cells", "a mass of tissue", "not a human being", "no heartbeat" "no brainwave therefore, not a human being yet", so if a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the creation of a human being then, like his female counterpart, should be able terminate his parental duty, that he never created, she did. He and she only created a cell not a human.
