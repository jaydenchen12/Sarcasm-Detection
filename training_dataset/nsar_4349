ok, no one said that i would look to a large govt for anything.  if individuals are better suited to solve environmental problems, i'd love to hear some of these solutions. this is why i started this thread, because the info out there is far from satisfactory. can you please explain how private individuals would, say, reduce co2 emissions from automobiles? or, maybe, protect an area that has been deemed a toxic waste dump from leaking toxins into the soil? or protect a certain species of bird or marsupial (some forest-dwelling creature) from having his habitat destroyed by logging, endangering the survival of the species? can you offer any libertarian solutions to the other problems i cited above?
