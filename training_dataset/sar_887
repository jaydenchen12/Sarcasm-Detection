As I have mentioned many times in these forums, one's personal view of abortion (i.e., whether it should be prohibited or permitted) has nothing whatsoever to do with whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned. If one supports the rule of law, then they would have to support the statement made by Senator McCain. Also, given that you don't like his stated position on gay marriage (i.e., that marriage is a state issue), it appears to me that you don't like democracy either.
