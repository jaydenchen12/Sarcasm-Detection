You claim that the distinction between a baby being a bodily function of a woman or not is a matter of ‰ÛÏempirical fact‰Û, this is just not so. I think you should rethink what ‰ÛÏempirical fact‰Û is. Empirical fact, are facts that are said to be true on the basis of empirical observation. If I see a light on in a room, that is an empirical observation, and for me, that the light is on, is an empirical fact. However, if you and I both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on, I think, is that there is indeed a fetus in a womb. I say that fetus is part of a persons body performing a function, you say its something else, and that's a mater if ideology, not mere observation.
