that's information to you, not to the organism. if someone says the mountain will not get higher on it's own, and you go and dump dirt on it; you have not disproven them. by information they mean that records anything useful for the organism, including specific functions. now the average anti-evolutionist would like it to be just specific functions in which case you could just say novelty (information on how to create new systems). dna records useful data (information) for other things, it records modifications of existing systems to adapt to the environment. deletions of detrimental code is also information, although the net change is a loss. as for my previous arguments, they have been that there is no known law, physics, or calculation that would cause the construction of an novel system; leaving only probability.
