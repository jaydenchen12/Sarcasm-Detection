Wasn't there some genius that wanted firearms locked up as a manditory model posting here? Gee if they can steal from the police station what punishment can we mete out for us unwashed working slobs for not locking up and reporting stolen firearms? Got them into Chicago even with its strict gun laws. Wonder if they complied with the IL gun laws? Yea right.emoticonXAgreeemoticonXBounceremoticonXEmbarrassed
