You're just not getting it. Either that or you're pretending to not get it. (I suspect it's the latter.) Dude, the point is you're making a pointless distinction. It doesn't say anything that Group A lies about ONE ISSUE while Group B doesn't, when Group B lies about THEIR pet issues just as much. YOU made an issue of them lying about "family values", as if lying about THAT ONE ISSUE sets Republicans apart as being worse that Dems in terms of hypocrisy. It doesn't. Get over it.
