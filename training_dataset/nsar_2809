If I would have been alive 100 years ago, would I have opposed having evolution taught in schools? Of course I would have, because I wouldn't have been able to forsee how the benefits that the study of microevolution, genetics, and other non controversial aspects of evolution have benefited society. Chances are there are equal, undiscovered things about intelligent design that could be discovered it we would give it a chance.
