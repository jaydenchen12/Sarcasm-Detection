Patellar? That's the front of the knee, what's that got to do with this argument.I've read the link, and just because it came out of Harvard doesn't mean that it's official or that it's of any measure of validity. It looks fancy but that doesn't mean it's truthful. So maybe you'd like to try again; with something not so biased next time.
