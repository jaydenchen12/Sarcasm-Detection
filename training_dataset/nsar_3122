Don't count on it. The number of scientists in the American scientific community that subscribe to creationism is about %5, based upon a relatively recent poll. I will try to dig it up.Also, calling most Kansas residents stupid for voting in Christian Board of Education members is ridiculous. Religious views are almost never even mentioned in local politics. At the most, you see perhaps a flyer that says "Vote ______". The Christians who want to teach Intelligent Design in schools are an extreme minority that the media, in all its story-searching rating-mongering glory, is blowing out of proportion.
