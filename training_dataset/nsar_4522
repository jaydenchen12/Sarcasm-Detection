emoticonxrolleyes no. not always credible. and i take it as credible. the woman's bias is not automatic cause for dismissal. you are biased against gay equality, but that doesn't mean your testimony is meaningless. newspapers have much higher standards for evidence. and as for 'should not be listened to', considering you take the self-contradictory bible as fact, written by people who were furthering their own superstitions, you're hardly a person to be criticizing... emoticonxrolleyes
