i watched a review of the film last night, the reviewer questioned moore on the rosy picture he paints of the nhs and basically moore said that even though nhs isn't perfect it is better than the us system. i will see this film, usually his films are well made no matter what you think of his political views. i do not know much about the us system, say you broke your leg and had to go in for an operation. would you need to pay for that operation?
