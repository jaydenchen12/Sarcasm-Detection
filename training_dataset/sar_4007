NONSENSE! What it is a reflection of is the sense of paranoia that the hard right religious radical lunatic fringe has created ever since 9/11. If YOU were panicked, suck it up! Others have suffered far worse and have managed to keep their perspective. The non-stop drumbeat from the Chicken Littles on the right is responsible for this and no one else.  Cheney on Meet the Press  this morning is a perfect example of this destructive attitude.
