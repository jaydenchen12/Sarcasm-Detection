don't add words that are not there. unbe-freakin-lievable! how many times do i have to repeat this...  the department shall post the required individual abortion form on its stable internet web-site. nothing in the individual abortion form shall contain the name, address, or information specifically identifying any patient. the department's individual abortion form shall be substantially similar to, but need not be in the specific format, provided in subsection f of this section do you understand what 'posting' means? my information is not posted on any 'secure web-site'. if it's posted, it's obviously available for anybody who wants to review it!
