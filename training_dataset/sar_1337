i used to think the answer to this was bin laden, but after reading an article called 'the brain' (playboy's june issue), i switched my opinion to khalid shieikh mohammed. does anyone else agree with me? this guy was the mastermind behind so many terrorist attacks (incl. 9/11) that it made my head spin. it was also surprising to read that he received his bachelor's degree here in the states, with classmates describing him as a 'class clown'. simply crazy, and scary when you think about it. thoughts or opinions? steve
