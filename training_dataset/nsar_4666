Maybe, but he's no centrist and with the way the congress looks he will most likely put very anti-gun judges in the Supreme court, which means the 2nd Amendment would be pretty much dead. Don't believe me? Look at California. Stupidest laws we have and they do not even work! Criminals still steal and buy illegal weaponry. The judges here are so far left, they themselves admit it! (Look up judge Reinhardt.) I'm not saying being a lefty is bad, it's just that it seems some would throw away a right just to "feel" safe. That's the worse thing YOU can do.
