To be honest, I have mixed views on the subject, but not enough interest to read pages of reporting on the disturbing events you are referring to, especially when someone considerate enough can give me the "jist" of what happened (THANK YOU Superlite27 for that) and at the same time help others that might browse this thread. Attack is not the only form of defence you know! emoticonXRolleyes (I'm just playing)
