Put a fork in it. Socialized medicine is DOA.The possible scenarios that could get the healthcare bill made into law are both suicidal moves that will cause the Democrats to become Washington outsiders in quick order. They are:1. Get the HR to pass the Senate Bill without any changes. This will be suicidal to the most liberal Democrats and the most Conservative ones, because the Senate Bill is a neutered version of the House Bill.2. They drag their feet on certifying Brown until after the reconsiliation process occurs so that they maintain their supermajority. This option is ever worse than Option 1 because it exposes every Democrat in Congress for the unprincipled b@#$%rds that they are and will cause a firestorm against them for years to come. If there's one lesson that crooked politicians should have learned by now, it's the lesson of Watergate. The people have long memories when it comes to blatant attempts to throw elections.
