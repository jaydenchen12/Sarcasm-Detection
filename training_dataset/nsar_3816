i would argue that the world is in fact buddhist. whether they call their faith or process buddhism or not the experience of suffering and overcome suffering is buddhist by nature.  you can see buddhism being embraced in almost every walk of life be it yoga or atheist solutions to problems / suffering, psychology, self help books. they may not call it buddhism but they are most certainly are buddhist principles repackaged in other forms.
