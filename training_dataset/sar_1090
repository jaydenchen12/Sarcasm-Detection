Two general observations: 1: Must you use the pejorative "tea bagger?" or does the simple mention of the term somehow convey some mystical argument defeating power?2: Regardless of how unsavory the means I don't think desperation prompted grave robbing equates to asking for a handout. Presumably the Pilgrims merely took a page from your playbook, declared keeping warm to be a "right" and simply cut out the gubment middleman.
