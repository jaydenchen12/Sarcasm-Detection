[Brain size is relevant compared to the rest of the body - its the proportions that matter. If you're small then you can have a smaller brain,this contradicts evolutionists' position. They have long measure brain size and correlated it with intelligence. Take homo erectus, for example. Evolutionists have long said homo erectus was some sort of sub-human because of the size of his brain. It doesn't matter that Turkana boy was short at about 5'5 and 10-13 years old -- and that his head size did not look proportionally small -- today's scientists don't care about any of that. They just measure his skull.
