And for decades, evolutionist fools proclaimed they had decoded the Book of Life‰Û_.they said that individual genes controlled individual traits. Well all that came to a crashing halt when the Human Genome Project showed that the one-gene/one-phenotype concept was indeed a fairytale. Instead, to the shock and dismay of teary-eyed evolutionists, they found that the human genome only has about 25,000 genes ‰ÛÒ over 100,000 short of their estimate. This meant their theory about how they thought life worked had to be scrapped.
