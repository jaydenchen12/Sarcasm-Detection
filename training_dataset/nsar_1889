Often, this debate becomes dotted with examples of things like human vegetables who might come out of their coma as potential people who aren't really people, or a person who was knocked out in a brawl as a potential person who is not (on some level) currently a person, and many other examples. We often believe it is immoral to kill people in these conditions, so the potentiality argument says that a fetus is just as sacred and requires our protection.
