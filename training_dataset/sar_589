I remember one woman who was in her 7th month of pregnancy, and she was taken to the emergency room of the hospital where I worked. All of a sudden she went into V-Fib ( Ventricular fibrillation ), which causes an arrhythmia (erratic head beat, more commonly known as cardic arrest. She was quickly transferred to the trauma centre, where I worked to take the baby thru Caersarian Section. I worked with 4 other M.D.'s trying to save both lives, and our work was valiant, to say the least. Sadly, we lost both the mother, and the child, no matter the heroics we used. I go to bed many a night, and I still see that lady's picture, and the stress she was in.
