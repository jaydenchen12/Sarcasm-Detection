what??? you mean they don't think that most people are out to exterminate gays? that most people actually do have reasons for their beliefs, and that the world doesn't always line up with the all-or-nothing 'equality-obsessed' modern gay pride movement?  who'da thunk it? emoticonxgood  the idea that most people hate gays is, of course, a propagandist view by the gay pride movement. i would hope judges wouldn't fall into that way of thinking, and the fact these judges did not shows they are good judges.
