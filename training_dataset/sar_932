I said considering the history of the issue. Marriage in America and in the modern British tradition, and in the modern Western tradition IS a fundamental right of free people and has been so for hundreds of years. If a state tried to overturn that system by banning marriage OR EVEN BY REFUSING to acknowledge and provide for civil marriage, I don't think it would be allowed.
