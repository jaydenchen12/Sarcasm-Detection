it is an absract concept, but i draw attention to the fact that no man can speak on this issue with the perspective that a woman can by virtue of the fact they can never be pregnant. so i suggest that it is very easy to say something is wrong when you cannot appreciate the fullness of the issue- a man will never be placed in the situation where they will be pregnant but do not wish to have a baby at that point.
