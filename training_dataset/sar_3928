with myself being one of the american sheep here, ( an alert one tho, ) i was hoping to see someone post a big secret, saying that our govt has a secret fuel source all ready to go , but were just holding out on it, until the oil was almost gone, and everyone had gotten all of their riches from the fossil fuel. then once the gas is almost gone, the govt would spring this new non-fossiled fuel out on to the public , a most opportune time to get the best price from it, of course... well, per daewoo, the above scenario is not true, so anyone with their eyes wide open can see where this is all heading. if someone doesnt do something soon, does orwell's 1984 or road warrior, come to mind ? :)
