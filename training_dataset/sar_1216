Because it is unjust.That is my ideal. I don't want anyone to have to suffer injustice, however if one group is going to pass laws they need to make sure they are subject to those laws.Everyone can commit murder and be subjected to murder laws. Only women have abortions so to have men decide what happens is unjust.
