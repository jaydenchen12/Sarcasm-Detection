Both atheists and agnostics will tell you they see no evidence for the existence of any god. Some will continue with "thus, there is not one" and other will continue with "as for the other, i don't know". The agnostic position is obviously tentative, however even though the atheist does not explicitly state his position is tentative, you will be hard pressed to find an atheist who states "there is absolutely, positively, with out a doubt, no god at all".
