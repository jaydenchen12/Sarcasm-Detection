well you can thank god for that then, because what you were proposing for single payer was some of the most ridiculous stupidity i'd ever seen. whenever anyone wanted to discuss it rationally you'd just spam the boards with another petition '72% of single mothers support single payer! 84% of single mothers reject raising taxes to pay for single payer! therefore we should go single payer!' i even recall you once berated steve for arguing in his own words instead of linking to a poll to support him. why do you think those numbers are relevant? popularity isn't a magic power that turns bad policy into good.
