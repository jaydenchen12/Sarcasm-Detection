this sounds utterly nutsy. it could only be said by someone who knows diddly squat about babies. hah! anger isn't an emotion? so, what do you think a new born baby goes through? what is this already? i'm out of my nice, cozy little nest, there are bright lights, loud noises unmuffled, it's cold, i feel icky and i am really angry! waaaaaaah! happiness isn't an emotion? whew! i went waaaaah and now i'm cozy and warm, my tummy is full, my bottom is dry, someone is cooing soothing sounds at me. . . . where is your head, steeeeeeve?
