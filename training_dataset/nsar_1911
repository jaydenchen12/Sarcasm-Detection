If all life evolved from a common ancestor, then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving.Body parts such as eyes, muscle, bone, etc.We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously.Evolutionists will wave the magic "time wand" and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades. What about fruit flies? One generation of fruit flies = around a day. Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts.Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction.Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800's. They are still looking.
