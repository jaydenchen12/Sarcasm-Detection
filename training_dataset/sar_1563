ask yourself this smiley, who gets life without parole ? mass muderers, first degree killers, pre meditated murderers, multiple offense rapist/killers, child abducter/rapist/murderers and convicted 3 strike violent felons. are you telling me that brutally violent repeat offenders who get off on causing human misery deserve the comforts of home as punishment for commiting these heinous crimes ? you see, i firmly believe that men can commit such terrible crimes that they forfeit their rights to breathe our air any longer. but short of the death sentance, then yes, life without parole should be hard and no fun whatsoever, and i mean ever.
