Do you not understand what is currently going on?The ruling on whether the California state constitutional amendment was enacted "legally" was ruled on by the courts.What is discussed above is entirely separate.To say something brief to get you up to speed, our state constitution CANNOT violate the federal constitution.So if Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment, then Prop 8 loses.Whether or not Prop 8 violates the 14th amendment is the question that is currently being examined.
