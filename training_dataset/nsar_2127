‰ÛBy creation we mean the bringing into being by a supernatural Creator of the basic kinds of plants and animals by the process of sudden, or fiat, creation. We do not know how the Creator created, what processes He used, for He used processes which are not now operating anywhere in the natural universe. This is why we refer to creation as special creation. We cannot discover by scientific investigation anything about the creative process used by the Creator.‰Û(italics in original, Duane Gish, Evolution? The Fossils Say No!, 1978, p42)
