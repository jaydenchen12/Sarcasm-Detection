i find that marc's notion funny that the us gov is shoving atheism down the country's throat, when the president is a self confessed christian and the party in power in both house's is the party that bible belt vote for. if the us government is trying to shove atheism down the nations throat then all those self confessed christians on capital hill must be charlatans.
