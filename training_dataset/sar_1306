I explicitly told you I was a catholic before 'converting' to objectivism, so forgive me for not being impressed with your powers of speculation. That doesn't change the fact that this was all well before I signed onto this forum so I know xcaliber has no quotes. I do not 'lean that way' just because I reject irrational evolution. I did not learn this skepticism from my catholic upbringing, as noted several times Catholics are ambiguous towards evolution.
