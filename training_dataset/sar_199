Then go away. If you have no interest, then why on earth are you even here to debate?Besides this, you're trying to put killing human beings on the same platform as animals or organic plant life. I'd seriously suggest you reconsider your views on what exactly is more important. You cannot put those things together, they mix about as well as oil and water.If the court or parental unit is not allowed to interfere with abortion plans, does the mother have the right to kill the child? Who is she to interfere with her child's life if her own parents can't make her live with a baby she can just give up for adoption?By the way, only 1% of abortions are made because of rape. If it were my decision, I would outlaw abortion altogether for the other 99% who have abortions irresponsibly and save over a million lives. Don't get me wrong, I do feel for victims of such crimes, but a few thousand hardly outweighs over a million. And they don't even have to die! They just have to live with a baby for a few months, and they can get on with their lives! It's more of a chance than the baby will get otherwise.
