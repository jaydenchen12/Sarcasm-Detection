please tell me more false assumptions you know about me? you my friend are idiotic. its obvious your attempt failed. you may want to try harder next time. now are you letting your 'arrogance' get in the way? you've clearly showed that you lack an open knowledgeable mind. you say all of that, but you can't back it up. all you've done is try to insult me. emphasis on the word 'try'. they still let old people like you get a ged, so i think you better get one as soon as possible. i'm not old... and i already have a college education, so no need to back track.
