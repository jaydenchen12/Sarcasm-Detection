You have two completely different things in your question so, I'll just split them up.Social programs (armed redistibution of wealth).I only agree with those allowed by the U.S. Constitution or by the respetive state constitution. I cannot find a provision in the U.S. Constitution which allows funding for social programs. Haven't read all the state constitutions so, I withhold comment on states.
