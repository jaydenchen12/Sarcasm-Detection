well, since you're the only presenting that argument, i'm glad you recognize how stupid it is so we can drop it. prove that. give evidence. anything. you said that someone who claims harm without evidence is a bigot. show us your evidence or admit to being a bigot. and lest you make a foolish claim, allow me to point out that the fact that you personally don't like how something is changing does not mean that's it's been harmed. you'll have to do better than that.
