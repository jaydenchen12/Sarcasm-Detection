well, one would think that a skeptic would only base assertions on objective ideas and motives rather than being a reactionary, which is basically what you are saying here. regardless of whether or not 'people go around loudly proclaiming that every single word of the bible is literally true, and that everyone should believe that' there should still be an objective way for skeptics to approach evidence for the existence of jesus. if what you say is true and skeptics are simply being reactionary, then that makes them all the more less objective in their approach.
