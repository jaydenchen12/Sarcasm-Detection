i don't know if you read the last part of my post, but i'll repeat it more clearly. a baby is always reliant and demanding of another person's care. a baby outside of the womb still depends on its mother (or somebody at least) to consistently keep him fed, to help him sleep and to change his diapers. a baby can stay alive for a bare minimum of time outside the womb, but it still needs care. viable may not be the right word for you. maybe i should say as 'genuine' a baby as the newborn. and you're correct when you said: ''the probability is progressively less with each fewer number of weeks.' but that only makes sense when the womb is empty. when the womb is occupied, it is occupied with a living functioning baby.
