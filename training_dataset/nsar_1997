I believe the filibuster issue relates to voting on judgeships only. ICBM, but this won't affect abortion issues.It's only recently that the Democrats have used the filibuster to delay the vote on appointed judges.I don't think there's any possibility of getting rid of filibusters all together.BTW, what's wrong with a pro-life court? ;)
