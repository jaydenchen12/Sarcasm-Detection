you can choose to have faith i whatever you want. some feel the bible represents the historical accounts of jesus. it could be mythical, magical or whatever. but, there are many who feel this is real and was produced to represent fact not fiction. you can choose to believe it or not. i don't think that the harry potter series was ever considered anything but fiction. and, i said i interpret it as i desire...not.others. yes, practices at the time condoned many of the things you state, but the bible was about jesus with many of the practices of the time added as historical color not relevant to the actual text itself.
