well, apparently the above 3 posters think iraq and the causes of said war are the most important thing to worry about. sad, but i think they missed your point.  i don't see it as what issues is america facing, but what issues are the individual american people facing. in my opinion, the issues most important to the individual person are the same as they have been for thousands of years. food, shelter, security from people and things trying to kill them, and their individual means to obtain these things. just a thought.
