Why did you even bother reading the proposal? Frankly I saw a rabbit in my yard yesterday and found it a lot more enlightening than what Obama thinks is a good idea.I got to "4 trillion over 12 years" and decided that was enough. For those who are divisionally challenged that comes to under $350 billion a year in "savings" when our deficit is about 5 times that THIS YEAR. Obviously in 12 years that won't be that much. So who cares what else it says. Don't waste your time.
