unlike today's anti-god revisionists, they didn't try to stifle or outlaw the mention of god in government, etc. that's your opinion. by essentially stating the word of god is a fairy tale and has no room in the debate is hardly edifying.  how about educating the heathens? surely god would want that, so they won't be lost and in the dark.
