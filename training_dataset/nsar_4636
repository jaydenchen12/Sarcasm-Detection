A chance mutation can do this by insertion. The codons for one protein are inserted or appended to the codons of of another. This is especially likely if the genes are near eachother. Another means by which this can occur is in the folding of the proteins. Two proteins can fold such that they interact because of their shape. If the proteins interlock or attach, they can form new combined structures.
