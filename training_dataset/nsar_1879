I think there is something wrong with Premse One. It translates into English as "If God exists, then he exists in all possible worlds." No logical rule justifies this statement. It is equally foolish to say that "If England exists, then it exists in all possible worlds." But clearly, England does not exist in the possible world where Earth never formed.
