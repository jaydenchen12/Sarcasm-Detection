But nobody is forcing you to support anti-Catholic policies. Of course, you have the right to support them, but don't try to make it sound as if you aren't making a conscious choice to do so. That's hypocritical.When my religious beliefs bump into the law, I've never had a gun held to my head by someone saying "support the law or else".
