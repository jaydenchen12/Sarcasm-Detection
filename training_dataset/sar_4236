well it seems that you basically lie, if you want to come to that basic conclusion. your link went to the second page of a thread. i requested a quote and a post # for the yec = christianity claim. you failed to provide that on this thread. you did not provide 6 different posts. you really do show a lot of arrogance and subjectivity that because you view 6 different posts as being evidence of something, that that makes it automatically true. you're basically saying that your spin is the truth and anyone who doesn't see things the way you do is dishonest. a perspective that is both arrogant and foolish. actually if you read the link you posted, you will see that the author is not just a christian who is neutral on yec, but he tends to favor creationism.
