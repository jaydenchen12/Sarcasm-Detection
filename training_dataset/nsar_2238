HOW OFTEN do you see people change their minds based on somebody fighting for "gay rights"?I have seen it, but it's only a handful of times.Out of HUNDREDS of people I've talked to, it's only a "handful of times".Suppose Democrats do pick up the gay banner hard and heavy. Full gusto.What's the effect?I seriously expect minimal.This is going to be a battle over time. Gays got sodomy laws overturned, and the reaction was anti-gay marriage laws and amendments.The SIMPLEST thing, that should have been the most obvious to everyone, of sodomy laws overturned got a "anti-gay marriage law/amendment" reaction.These fights ARE BEING picked and chosen.ROFLMAO!No. We fundamentally disagree there.How long have you been arguing the gay marriage issue.And you state that you SUPPORT equality on every issue with only the gay marriage hold-out, right?If YOUR mind can't be changed in all that time, why do you think that we could win over the nation just by having Democrats come out hot and heavy.Furthermore, THINK about it.HOW LONG have we been pushing for ENDA...And we just tried the vote, and it failed...EVEN ON THE ISSUE THAT HAS OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SUPPORT, the anti-gays are able to stop the win.What do you think will happen on an issue we DO NOT have majority support on?
