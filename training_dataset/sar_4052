this seems to be a mixture of pascal's wager and shocking evidence of eternal cruelty and torture from the god of love. pray tell, arch, what is meant by 'the second death'? will you confirm or deny that symbolic fire means eternal destruction, not eternal torment? can you provide scriptures that confirm that the ungodly will be tortured for eternity in indestructible bodies? why would a god of love torture people for eternity? why would you want to worship such an evil creature if that was the case?
