true perhaps. the ba'ath party sanctioned all of the killings of innocent civilians back then.  ragged militias? you clearly have no grasp on the nature of the militias that we are fighting in iraq. they are organized, well funded, well supplied, and highly motivated. we certainly could reign all of the militias in if we really wanted to, but the world would probably not approve of the method. so what of it? don't think i am going to sit here and defend bush. i have n control over what the man says and when he says it. personally, i stopped listening to what he had to say a long time ago.  what reasons to be specific? why don't you spell them out for the whole class to hear.
