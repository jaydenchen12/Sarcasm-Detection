i think you may be taking our objections a bit too seriously. what he said was stupid and homophobic, sure. but i have no idea who this guy is or how big an audience, if any, he has. if i thought he had the country's ear, if he was running for office, if he set policy; then i'd be concerned. as it is, i'm quite content to just point out what an idiot he seems to be.  and i'm curious. you don't actually think that anyone who supports gay rights in any way could find that piece anything but disrespectful, do you? granted, he may not be worth worrying about, but he clearly has no respect for gays at all.
