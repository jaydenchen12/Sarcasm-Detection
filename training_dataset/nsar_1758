We saw this in the recent Supreme Court decision. They chose to focus a lot on the role handguns could play in defending house and home against criminals, but seemed to have no problem with a ban on machine guns- the kind of guns that would logically seem to be most protected by the Second Amendment because of their usefulness in military conflicts which would make them a better deterrent against tyranny than other types of firearms. Thus, the Supreme Court chose to "strain at a gnat and swallow a camel" to use a Biblical idiom in their treatment of the Second Amendment.
