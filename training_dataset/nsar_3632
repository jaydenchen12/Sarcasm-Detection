er, say what? dunno about you, but that link takes me directly to my post there. (just tried the link 4 different times with the same result) post 60, page 4. bottom of the page (your browser should automatically scroll it down because of the post number in the link). either you didn't take a look at the link, or you did and your browser didn't take you to the bottom of the page ad you were too lazy to look for the post. oh, go ahead. ips don't mean all that much when one merely needs to have two different networks set up (giving two different ips), or go to, say, a library with internet access and then back home.
