i just wonder why the polls showed such support for bush at first, but after the liberal press got their claws in him and began tearing away, suddenly the support waivered. are you gonna tell me that this change in support comes from logical thought? c'mon, i give you a little more credit than that. most americans interpret? geeeeeeez, most americans don't know their a** from a hole in the ground, they just listen to the sound bytes that are dished out by the liberal press
