But one idea that makes me hesistate to be pro-choice is an analogy. Imagine a hunter who sees something moving behind a bush. It could be a deer, it could be a human, or it could be something else. The hunter lacks the information to know for sure what is behind the bush. What is the ethical policy for a hunter in this situation? It seems clear to me: if you are not sure it's not human, don't kill it.
