The invisible pink flying panda says you're wrong. Prove that it doesn't exist. I take it you have no formal education whatsoever?I take it you have no understanding of science, much less the scientific method? You're just dumb. The age of the Earth hasn't changed in decades. You can go look up old biology textbooks from the 60s and the number is still the same. Therefore either you're lying, or you're being fed lies. Yeah, from 4.5 billion years to 4.500001 billion years. In terms of our lives, that's not important.It amazes me just how dumb creationists are. And you clearly are trying to rely on a attack on science to support creation. Hence why many of us believe that Creationism cannot be defend or supported on its own merits
