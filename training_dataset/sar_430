Can you imagine the cost for every abortion clinic if they owned their own medical waste incinerator? Here's EPA info about the required policies for Medical waste Disposal; http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/129/hmiwi/rihmiwi.html and here's why there are services like this one which take care of that for them. http://www.medicalwastesolutions.com/ Some large hospitals have incinerators due to the large amount of waste they produce, but abortion and small health clinics are way too small to justify the expense.
