I am curious as to why you specifically exclude self defense as a valid reason for owning a gun. Data from the FBI shows that victims who resist an aggressor by use of a gun are less likely to be injured than when they use other weapons for defense. I would think that this alone would validate the ownership of a gun for defensive use. On a related note, as was recently confirmed by the SCOTUS, owning a firearm is an individual right. I am not aware of any other right that you are required to to demonstrate a reason prior to exercising.
