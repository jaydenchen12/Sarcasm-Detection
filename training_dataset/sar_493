How ironic you would even care since (1) you've opposed saving the lives of 101,000 of your fellow Americans who died this past year because of inadequate care, and (2) you think people should defend themselves with their own guns and stop burdening taxpayers with police departments.Oh and do take notice of the costly tasteless suit who came downstairs from the corporate palaces to arrogantly stand next to the underpaid cop in N.Y.C., and as if he owned the city's police forces.Anyone know that Costly Tasteless Suit's name?
