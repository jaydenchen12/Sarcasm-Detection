polgamy is against the law, living your life as a lesbian is not. that is why i said if i saw a polygamous marriage situation, i would contact the authorities, because in more cases than none; young women are being taken advantage of by someone much older; the tom green situation. but, the way your life is lived, i would protect to my last breath and continue to work for equality for one and all.
