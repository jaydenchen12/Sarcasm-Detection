why is it moot? do pregnant women who are choosing adoption suddenly don't have themselves and dependents to care for. if i were pregnant and said pregnancy would prevent me from providing for myself or my son i would end it. the question was why some women choose abortion over adoption. one reason is because the pregnancy is a threat to being able to provide for oneself. and your definition of selfish disgusts me. whooooosh.
