i think i know where your head has been lodged but i will refrain from saying it here. you obviously missed the whole part i cut-and-pasted about tadpoles. you need to do some reading on evo devo. in polyphenic development, hormones control a switch between alternative developmental pathways so that individuals with identical genotypes can develop dramatically different phenotypes. the hormones that control polyphenic development (juvenile hormone, ecdysteroids, and a few neurohormones) are the same as those that control insect metamorphosis. hence an understanding of the endocrine regulation of metamorphosis has proven essential for understanding the control of polyphenic developmental switches.  http://www.biology.duke.edu/nijhout/polyphenism.htm your silly theory is way outdated. get with the times, man.
