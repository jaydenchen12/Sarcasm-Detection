this is actually simply a place for intelligence to prevail, and for unsupported ideas to be hacked down like hogs hung from a meat hook. if christianity is a worthy religion, it will stand the test of extreme scrutiny. history will support it and the text inside the bible will always speak the truth about society, and how god wants us to live (assuming there is a god, that he directed the writing of the bible, and that he put in the bible what he wanted his creations to do/how to live their lives).
