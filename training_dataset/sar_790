Atheists do, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they represent science. You haven't gotten in over your head ‰ÛÒ most who post here don't know much about science. TQ doesn't, and of course he'll tell you that I don't. There's a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. Many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel ‰ÛÏintellectually fulfilled‰Û, to discredit religion. Some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn't written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. Michael Ruse and Bradley Monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. Religious authors, practically too many to name. William Dembski, David Berlinski, Phillip Johnson, Cornelius Hunter, many others. You would do well to read anything by any of these people. Far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like Richard Dawkins. He's become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. Read ‰ÛÏThe Edge of Evolution‰Û, or ‰ÛÏDarwin's Black Box‰Û sometime. :)
