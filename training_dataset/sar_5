This is pure paranoia. What evidence do you have to support you're point of view? Why don't you actually do a little research yourself. Handgun Control Inc was founded by two victims of gun-violence. Sarah Brady joined Handgun Control Inc after her husband received brain damage from a bullet. Senator Ted Kennedy also supports gun-control because some of his family members were killed with guns. Many people who support gun control have experienced the horrors of gun violence firsthand and are just trying to make our nation a safer place. It's not because they are power hungry.
