i prefer the playstation because you get to have free to play online and you don't have to pay online.  you have some major titles that xbox doesn't have like infamous, ratchet and clank series, uncharted, god of war, the last of us, sly 1,2,3,and 4, jack and daxter collection, killzone, heavy rain, resistance, and others that i can't name off the top of my head.  playstation does make updates on things the reason they came out with the slim ps3 was to prevent the yellow light of death to other users who had that problem because their ps3 overheated.  xbox had the same problem as well but they had the red ring of death and they changed the color of their xbox to the black and they have slim as well.
