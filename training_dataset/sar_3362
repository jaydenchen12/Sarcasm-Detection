have you even read the other arguments? or even researched the topic? i don't care if you're a christian, that's cool and your belief, but give credit where credit is due. christians made the holiday a christian holiday mostly as a way to convert more people. but it's not really a christian holiday, nor do i understand how buying materialistic items or receiving them is very christian...
