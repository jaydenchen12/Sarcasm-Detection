First thing I want to say is that I dont want to offend anyone but for me abortion was the best option. I also want to say that I love Christ will all my heart. He has forgiven me for my sins and because ive had an abortion does not mean im not a Christian and yes I was a christian when I did have an abortion. I had an abortion just this past june. ...I grew up in a christian home and was anti abortion most of my life but honestly I felt so relieved after having the abortion.
