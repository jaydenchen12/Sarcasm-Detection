Just thought I'd share about secular rights for gays...not "special rights" but equal rights...No, homosexuals do not have the same rights as heterosexuals do. We cannot serve in the military because of our sexual orientation. We do not all have protections against being fired because of our sexual orientation.As for the secular rights, I don't think this is right.From a religious standpoint, I've never seen more ignorance, hatred or twisted lies put into words as I have on this board from some of the folks who are Christians. Personally, I don't see the difference between what is "good" and what is "evil" when it comes to religion on here. I've seen satanists say nicer things than what has been written here.If this is your idea of what is good, I want no part of it.As far as the two, secular rights and religious rights, it seems that although the constitution has a freedom of religion clause in it, faith based people cannot and will not separate the two out making the separation clause invalid...what's the point in that?
