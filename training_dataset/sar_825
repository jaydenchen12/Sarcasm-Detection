Heck, no. You've convinced me. I say let them have sex! Let them have sex with whomever they want. Your imaginary friends who want to have sex with their relatives can and should go do it. I support the right of imaginary people to have sex with whomever they want and to marry whomever they want! Power to the imaginary people! Give them liberty or give them imaginary death!
