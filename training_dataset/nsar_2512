Folks should be aware that every state in the United States except Florida allows gay people to adopt as single parents. The issue comes in many states when a same-sex spouse tries to adopt as a second parent. Some states permit this and some states do not. It's weird indeed that all states except one allow single gay people to adopt children, but many do not allow gay couples to be adoptive parents together. It makes no sense to me, since two parents are usually better than one.
