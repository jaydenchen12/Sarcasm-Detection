omegamon_x said something in another thread that that raised some questions in my mind: mainly: why? specifically, why worry about the threat of potential harm from criminals? statistically, the risk of such is relatively low compared to, say,  the leading killer in the developed world. you face a much greater threat of potential harm from that than at the hands of a criminal. are you as adamant about eating healthy as you are about the need to have a gun? the fact is, we all constantly face the threat of potential harm every minute of every day. risk is a part of living. i would like to know why guns specifically are needed to mitigate the risk of being the victim of a crime, when other methods (better locks, alarms, non-lethal weapons like pepper spray and tasers) can be effective.
