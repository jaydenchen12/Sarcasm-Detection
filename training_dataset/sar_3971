i'd be more than happy to take responsibility for every baby that i sire. in fact, i have three. you want to remove the element of accountability because you don't like it. too bad! and you want it to remain legal because it will occur anyways? emoticonxconfused what kind of twisted logic is that? should we make incest legal? after all, it's going to occur anyways. emoticonxrolleyes
