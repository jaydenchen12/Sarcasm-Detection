you have demonstrated my point. you seem capable of responding to issues in only two ways - either quoting the bible as 'proof' of something, or pasting in some tedious, non-reputable and peripherally related quote. i say your interactions are not honest because you persist in these diversions, instead of directly answering with ideas that came out of your mind. certainly a discussion of religion may involve the bible, but it doesn't always have to. you are incapable of understanding that a bible quote is not proof of anything other proving those words are in the bible. (and even that...) please consider coming to the real world of adult debate where the expectation is that you actually express you own ideas. parroting back some tired platitude is not intellectually honest debate.
