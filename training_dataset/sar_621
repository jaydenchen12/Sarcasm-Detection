"The Sword of TRUTH" SCOFF! Why must truth be accompanied with a tool of violence? Only the religious possess the shameless audacity of claiming exclusive possession of truth and backing their claims with VIOLENCE. Religion / christianity is negated by the very FACT it is violent and indeed "lunatic"!
