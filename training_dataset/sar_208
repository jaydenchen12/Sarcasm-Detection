Very interesting, cuz I was born in Liberal Democratic Boston Mass to a Sunni Moslem Mother and a Shiite Moslem Father and yet here I am a Right Wing, Born Again Conservative Republican Christian. And have been a right wing thinking and conservative even before I accepted jesus as my savior. Weird huh ? I guess your little geographical generalization forgot to take into account the individual free will that each of us possesses.
