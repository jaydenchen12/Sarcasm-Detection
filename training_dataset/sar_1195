He believes also that the genealogy between Adam and Noah allows for an accurate accounting of the years between the two events. His main point to me was that although we know that the bible doesn't give a complete genealogical record, where it does, it is reliable. And that is what I have been saying all along too. I'm not questioning what the bible DOES SAY. I'm questioning WHAT IT DOESN'T SAY. But for the time being, until I can support what bothers me about dating the Creation of the World using genealogies, then I must concede that this record from Adam to the flood is as accurate a record as is possibly available at this time according to the bible.
