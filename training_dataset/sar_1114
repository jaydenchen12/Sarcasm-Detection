You should use the entire quote rather than cut to attempt to prove what you aare about. "When defending yourself in Australia you must use equal force. THis means you must use the SAME weapon as the criminal. So no baseball bat V knife. Once you locate the same weapon as the armed criminal has you must then use Reasonable force to bring him down. This means you are NOT allowed to kill him and once he is down you are not allowed to touch him again. Now if you have 2 criminals both with different weapons you must use the weapon one has on that one then change for the other. The catch 22 is if he has a gun you are screwed as using any weapon to defend yourself is ILLEGAL." Comprende?
