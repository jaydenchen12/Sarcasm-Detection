I agree with you, that's just plain silly. First of all we don't know if a soul even exist, and secondly, even if we had proof that it did, we have no way of knowing when it becomes reality for that person. Maybe it's like sin, you know, a man-made concept ;) You want to consider a ZEF a 'person' - fine, let's apply this so-called 'logic' across the board. If a woman should for whatever reason die while giving birth, then the baby should serve a life prison sentence for murder emoticonXGood Have a nice day emoticonXAngel
