hey speaking of clueless, what would you call the rather significant increase in the percentage of wealth for the top 5% over the last couple decades? how about redistribution of wealth.  how about trickle down economics? you realize in order for that to have a chance to work you have to keep the incentives for the rich to invest that money domestically. otherwise they get the breaks and then ship that extra wealth offshore where it stays because there is no incentive to bring it back. thems good numbers making folk using them things they teach in them fancy city colleges.  if you could see past last week and next week you might understand the slow erosion of the things that are in place to make some of these ideas work.
