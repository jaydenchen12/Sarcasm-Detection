Well, you stated that gun control "worked well" in Europe during the 30s, which was the time of the holocaust. By stating gun control "worked well", I assumed that you supported or condoned what the nazis were doing to the Jews. However, I assume I was incorrect. And regarding you and Steeeve's childish attacks, I will ignore them at the moment, but if you decide to resume this behavior I will be forced to report it.
