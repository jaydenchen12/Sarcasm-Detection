No, you're mixed up. You see, Superman is a fictional comic book character who was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster back in the 30s. Jesus is the true Messiah of humanity who in fact did save the World from Spiritual Darkness. He defeated death and even travelled in ways that defied the laws of physics after being crucified and presumed dead by His murderers. Jesus Christ is the real Superman. Any powers you attribute to the fictional character Superman, you can accurately attribute to Jesus and you wont find him wanting. I'm a real fan of Superman, but I love, worship and trust my eternal life to Jesus Christ. With that said, I'm calling it a night and have no desire to help you continue to mock the Lord.
