At the risk of becoming embroiled in a seemingly heated exchange, I think I might interject with a little history....To answer Smiley's question: ‰ÛÏwho wrote the constitution?‰Û I would say the answer is found in the preamble to the document: ‰ÛÏWe the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.‰Û (bold emphasis added)
