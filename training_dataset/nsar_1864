No, your idea about science is a philiosophy of science. Sure, it's got a lot of believers, but historically it is not the only vision of science people have believed in.There is metaphysical evidence. The Apostles saw Jesus walk on water. There was no 'measure' by your version of science, but what they saw remains true.
