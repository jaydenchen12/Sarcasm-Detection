Civil rights have nothing to do with the religion. If they were based on what the Bible allowed, women would only be looked at as child-bearing, housekeeping, subservient wives. Slavery would be allowed and Girls would get married after having their first period. It's one thing to live in accordance with your beliefs, it's something entirely different to make others live by your rules.
