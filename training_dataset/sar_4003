homosexuality can be cured and that studies show that long-term, monogamous relationships for homosexual couples are unlikely. the success rate for reparative therapy is about one-third, about the same as the success rate in other psychotherapy. there are not two kinds of people  homosexual and heterosexual, there are two kinds of people  heterosexuals who know that they are heterosexual and heterosexuals who dont know that they are heterosexual. there is no scientific evidence of a homosexual gene or any of the other politically correct explanations of homosexuality. the actual fact is that long-term relationships are almost non-existent among homosexuals. studies show the number of couples who are able to maintain fidelity for longer than five years is zero.
