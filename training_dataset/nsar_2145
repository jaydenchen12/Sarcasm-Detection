I disagree. Well maybe technically. Let's look at it this way. Criminals' access to guns may even go slightly up, because there are SOME criminals who may not want to obtain a handgun illegally. But the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than that of criminals, thus less criminals will want to commit a robbery or something with the fear of the person living there owning a gun. Criminals may forget getting a gun anyway so maybe indirectly, but the major problem is access to guns, not ownership of guns. Access will go up, no one disputes that, but people using them for self-defense goes much higher so that more than makes up for the increase in access for criminals. Make sense?
