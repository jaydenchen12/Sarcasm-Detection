I agree wiht you for the most part. however Jews ahve not suffered very much in terms of minorities like other minorities. I do think that popelpe should take advantage of the opportunities instead of just asking for more.That still doesn't change the fact that minorities are disadvantaged due to the government's actions and negligence.
