i doubt you have any... it isn't like this is the first time this has come up. so lets see it. it is essential to your argument so you need to provide it. and you just assume the evidence relates to the fact? perhaps you assume the evidence tested is tested in methods are in reality logical. you beg the question no matter how you look at it which is why you have to have faith in something. well, many definitions of the word fact. i think it is useless to argue this. a fact can just mean 'a truth that exists' or it can be a 'something known to exist'....so, whatever. human (n): 1. a member of the genus homo and especially of the species h. sapiens. 2. a person is the embryo not of species homo sapien?  perhaps you were home schooled
