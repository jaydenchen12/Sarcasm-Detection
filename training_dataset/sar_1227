I don't see that either of them were "protesting". I would however say that they were both making a statement. Cindy even makes it clear in her letter that she was making a statement. Now I certainly think that Cindy should have been simply removed rather than arrested, but whats done is done. I am glad to see that the senators wife was removed as well. I have nothing against the positions expressed on either of their shirts. I do however believe that the only one who should be making a statement at the SOTU is the president, and therefore I would in the future support the removal of anyone who follows this path. Perhaps a dress code would eliminate this XXXX in the future. Apparently decorum means nothing anymore.
