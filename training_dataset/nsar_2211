:It probably would have been better if Scalia had said to himself when the case was brought before the court, "There certainly is no consensus about the meaning of the Second Amendment and I, as an amateur historian, am certainly not going to force my own personal views on others. I will let the people decide through their elected representatives how much gun control is necessary in their own communities." Nice interpretation by Dennis Henigan of HCI. He would have loved that but pretending it hasn't been ruled as an individual right by the 82nd Congress, the DOJ in August 2004 with all the history and also by 35 Supreme Court rulings and TWO CENTURIES of lower court cases that fills a 660 pg. book with majority opinion, he is either deaf/blind or outright deceitful...I opt for the latter.He and they know full well that all the courts now are bound to consider any Second Amendment case as a civil rights issue thanks to this ruling."letting people decide" has already been done, once when the Constitution was ratified with the BOR and again when the XIVth Amendment was passed. He may as well say race issues will be decided by elected representatives the racial balance necessary in their own communities"He is completely dishonest and knows full well that this is a Republic based on the Law of the Land, The Constitution and not a democracy as he suggests. One may as well follow the Piper over the cliff like a herd of lemmings to not recognize this time worn tune played by the gun grabbers.
