Similarly, every mutation that has ever occurred has had a definite proximate cause, and if we knew what they all were and what they would all be in the future, evolution would lie mapped out before us in all its detail. Nevertheless, in the absence of perfect knowledge of these individual causes we can still describe the occurrence of such events statistically, saying how long we might have to wait, or how many trials we might conduct in order to expect a given outcome. So to say that the evolution of the nylon bug, for instance, was based on chance is misleading: the evolution of the nylon bug was based on whatever proximate cause shuffled its DNA.
