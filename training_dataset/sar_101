It has to do with freedom and equality but then again I do not expect non empathic people to understand that. Looking at you answers below I would have though you would understand the concept that I get to choose who I share my life with, who I transfer my property too and who I call family. You do not understand that the government says to everyone who is a family by the issuance of that piece of legal paper. The in equality part comes in when I am told that I can not have that piece of paper but some hetero can because someone else has a religious belief that should have no effect on my life what so ever. I am saying that if so religious XXXXX wants to force their religion on me by using that religion as an excuse for the state not issuing me that piece of paper then I want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief. If the religious XXXXXX stay out of my life then I will stay out of theirs but if they want to get involved in my life then I want to get involved in theirs. EYE FOR AN EYE equality by its very definition. You want the government out of your life and I want religion out of my government and my life.
