So they (pro-life peeps) say abortion is murder. Of course, you can only murder people. So their rule is that fetuses (feti?) are people also. But then they can't explain why fetuses aren't listed on the US Census, or why there isn't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage. Pretty much, along with the rules of having children, you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception, you would have to pay taxes for children, even if you're only pregnant, etc.Or am I missing something? Care to clarify, anybody who disagrees?
