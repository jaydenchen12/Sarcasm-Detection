I'm still having a hard time with this. If nothing exists, no matter, then how can "the number one" exist? On what basis is it defined? If there is only nothing, then you can't add to it, like I said 0+0=0.I know this is getting slightly off topic and philosophical, but it would seem to me that "concepts", and I'm not sure exactly how that's being defined, must have a basis in reality, and therefore in matter.I agree in that they are not created. I disagree in that IMHO, they are a function of our physical universe. IMHO, you don't have the concept without the universe to "define" it. I don't know, it's too early in the AM, maybe someone can point out the errors in my thinking.Waxy
