hmm, interesting philosophy. This debate is on whether ID SHOULD be in the science curriculum as a valid alternative to evolution. You're justification is that science already has theories that are unproven, so ID should be taught too? Besides the fact that this isn't true, shouldn't you be fighting against abiogenesis instead of for it and ID?
