I think the risk from the Christian Right is less the theocracy, but that they will stifle scientific development and education to the degree that the US loses its major asset, innovation. We're already seeing this with regard to stem cell research. This isn't to say that ethics should be disregarded in science, far from it, but if the US raises a generation of kids who think science is satanic then the possibilities for development are going to be slim.
