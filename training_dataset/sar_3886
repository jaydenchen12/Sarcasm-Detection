the fetus is non-sentient, so it has no 'desire'. the fetus is totally dependent on a woman's body, and has no existence without the woman's body. this is not the case with a dog. this is not the case with the woman. she is a sentient person, and not a container. she undergoes physical changes and physical risks by being pregnant. she risks, and she sacrifices, using her own body. it is selfish of a man to think he can control her body and her life. it will never have the same kind of impact on his health and on his life, that it will have on hers. not even close.
