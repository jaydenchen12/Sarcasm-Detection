i suggest that nobody should respond to ez's demands for a cure-all solution until he publicly acknowledges that one may be capable of spotting a problem without necessarily knowing how to fix it. i have submitted as much to him before with no response. he simply acts as if the question has not been asked. perhaps our conversations with ez would be more fruitful if we agreed amongst ourselves which question we wanted answered, and simply all asked him that question, over and over again, whatever he posts, until he answers it? i know matthew s has a few like that he's still waiting on an answer for; could we add this one to the list?
