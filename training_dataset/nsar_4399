seems your post has take the wrong turn. somebody with the opposite view may post. 'who should make the choice,the state or the feckless woman who refused to use birth control?' dont try the rape bs.the amount of abortions carried out due to the woman not bearing to be able to come to term with a rapist's baby is negligable compared to women who abort their babies due to lifestyle choice. i still think you are simones sock puppet
