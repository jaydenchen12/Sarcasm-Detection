the question was about whales. pay attention will you? you're right; i didn't type anything in at all. i just asked huntard to prove his claim. but in response to your propaganda piece, here's some opposing evidence. the third problem, 'as zimmer acknowledges', is that there aren‰Ûªt very many early whale fossils. does that surprise you? evolutionists have probably led you to believe that the fossil evidence for whale evolution is, pardon the expression, rock-solid. but there isn‰Ûªt really that much 'hard' evidence. whale evolution is mostly imaginary, or speculative at best. since whales are mammals, evolutionists imagined that a land-going mammal must have returned to the sea. at first, they imagined this without any fossil evidence. so, they went looking for fossils to support their preconceived ideas. the first hint that they were probably right came in 1983, when researcher phil gingerich found a 52-million year old skull in shallow deposits in pakistan. although fragmentary, the skull had teeth that were nearly identical with those of mesonychids and the archaeocetes. ‰Û_ despite the whale-like characteristics of the skull, however, pakicetus lacked two important adaptations which are present in modern whales. in living whales, the ears contain large sinuses that can be filled with blood, allowing the animal to maintain pressure while diving. modern whales also transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear using a 'fat pad', which allows them to hear directionally underwater. pakicetus lacked both of these features, indicating that it was unable to dive deeply and that it could not hear well underwater. these anatomical clues meshed well with its habitat, since the pakicetus bones were found in deposits that had been laid down at the mouth of a river on the shore of a shallow sea, where the opportunities for deep diving would be limited. although no post-cranial bones of pakicetus were found, it seemed logical to assume, from the teeth and ear structure, that the animal spent a great deal of time in shallow water looking for food, but returned to the land to rest, somewhat like a modern sea lion. ‰Û_ the earliest known cetacean, pakicetus, demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans are descended from the mesonychid carnivores. although we have not found any post-cranial bones from pakicetus yet, ... 5 consider what this evolutionist has just told us. first, they haven‰Ûªt found any post-cranial bones of pakicetus. [since this essay was written, they have found some post-cranial bones.] post-cranial bones are bones below the skull. so, all they have found is a skull. they don‰Ûªt have a single pakicetus rib. they don‰Ûªt have any pakicetus vertebrae. no other bones of any kind. just a skull--and a fragmentary one at that. why do they think it came from a whale ancestor? because its teeth look like whale teeth. but when they look at the ear bones, there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater. the skull was found in association with other fossils that lived on the bank of a river or along the sea shore. yet it ‰ÛÏdemonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans [whales] are descended from the mesonychid carnivores.‰Û in a whale of trouble so the claim is made based only on the teeth because no other evidence supports such a conclusion. that's real complete and reliable information that justifies making such an absolute claim from. not!!! emoticonxdonno
