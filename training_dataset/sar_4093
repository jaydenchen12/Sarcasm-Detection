i've got no problem with it. geez, your not normal if you don't have it circumcised. some woman won't want you (sexually) because of it. babies don't remember the pain.  and its not just for religious purposes, come on, the main reason is for hygienics . you could get an infection or something at an older age and have to get that done at 15-16 or so on. how painful would it be to get it then.  i am happy i am circumcised, and i am glad my parents did it.
