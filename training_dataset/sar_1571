The topic did not change. The topic was the reasons for the French no vote which certain posters originally claimed was a vote against Chirac, and when I asked them to back it up with evidence. The only 'evidence' they could cite was that commentators said that, so it was so. When I said that I heard commentators saying that Turkey and fears of globalisation were the main reasons for the French no vote, then the same posters who had earlier claimed that the French no vote was a vote against Chirac now changed their tune and said Turkey and fears of globalisation were reasons as well. So please keep with the thread of this disucussion will you. I know its hard work for you but try to remember how this topic got started in the first place.
