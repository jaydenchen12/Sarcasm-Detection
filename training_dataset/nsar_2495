lol. That's silly. Scientific facts keep changing, because they keep building on what is proven. The actual basis for the facts hasn't changed at all, merely the newest accepted idea is. As time progresses that idea is tested, tested, tested and tested again until it is proven. Your statement reveals sheer ignorance as to the scientific process.
