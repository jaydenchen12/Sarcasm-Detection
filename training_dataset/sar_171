Of the court cases that have been decided over 92% have resulted in convictions. Statistically, it's highly unlikely that there will be big deviance from this pattern for the remaining cases. I don't think presenting information that shows that people with concealed handgun permits very likely kill more innocent people than criminals is a punch in the face to the VPC.
