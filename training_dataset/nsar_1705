The greatest possible (anything you can name) can only exist in a finiteseries. As you point out, this is not the case in an infinite series such asintegers. So the definition that began this thread that God is identified as"the greatest being possible" must limit the possibilities to a finite number.As I write this I can see that it's self-evident - but what I can't see is howthis gets us any closer to showing that God exists (or not) !
