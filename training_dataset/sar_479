if this is directed at me, you are far off base. if jim ws born during wwii, he is old enough to be my father, and yes, his generation pretty much scrapped this country with their idiotic fiscal policies and moronic foreign policy. what we should probably do to set things right is put them all on an island, and let the terrorists go to town on it. we will not have lost much and the country will be a better/stronger place without them.
