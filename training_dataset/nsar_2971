First off the single common ancestor model has no demonstratable mechanism for how it is even possible. For another thing no substantive reasoning that all scientists use is empirically testable which is why subjective/objective duality is the philosophy of natural science. There is only a need to discern between the substantive reasoning (theoretical) and empirical testing (demonstrative). Objectivism is based on substantive reasoning just like scientific positivism or natural selection for that matter. None of these things are subject to peer review since there is a distinction between subjective and objective reasoning.
