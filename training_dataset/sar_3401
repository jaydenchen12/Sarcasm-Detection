atheists believe in god.... they just don't want to believe in god because they are in rebellion to god. a parallel is that of a parent and child. when the child does something bad and the parent comes to punish him or her, he or she refuses to accept that he or she has done wrong or that he or she deserves punishment and he or she then rebells to the point of extreme anger. atheists are just angry at god for no real reason.
