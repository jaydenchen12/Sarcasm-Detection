the concept of a gay family makes me a little uncomforatable, but i can't formulate any logical arguements to support marrige segregation. by default, i am a supporter of gay adoption. any two loving people can bring up a family just fine. as for marrige, it began as a religious institution, but has been ingrained into american society as a cutural union. gay people deserve the right to recognition in front of the world as a couple, as a partnership. spicygirl is more uncomforatable with gay couples than i will ever be, and that will never change. i would bet money she hasn't figured out her sexuality just yet. that aside, there is no logical argument to deny gays rights. if you have one, i would love to hear it.
