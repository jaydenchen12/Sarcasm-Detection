While I am not a huge fan of polls, one of the positions often held by those of us on the pro gun side of the debate is that those in favor of stricter firearms law, are not familiar with firearms or current firearms law.I would be interested to know what level of knowledge is possessed by both sides of the argument. Please be honest. Justin
