ooo, you had your gut cut open??  what a pity. i think you could have avoided alot of suffering if you had just used a condom. if you don't want another mouth to feed then just take birth control or use a condom.  why shouldn't fetuses have rights? once they're a fetus, then eliminating them is technically killing them. and at nine months, they're no longer dependent on it's mother's blood, and therefore is technically a baby. at nine months, you're not killing a fetus, you're killing a baby.
