But what you don't seem to get is that this will probably happen by default. It's not a matter of 'potential', it WILL happen in most cases unless outside intervention (killing it) takes place. That's beyond potential; that's the rule. An unfertilized egg cannot become a person; an embryo more than likely WILL unless something external kills it. You are inaccurately minimizing the difference there, IMO. One will likely "become a person", the other will absolutely not.
