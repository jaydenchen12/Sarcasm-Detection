this is the part you are misquoting. 'it is not within judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel of less than 18 inches in length is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.' now it states the shotgun with a barrel length of eightteen inches is not military equipment.  so if the anti gun/gun control advocates are going to use this to defend their claim they are wrong.
