we are not talking about the life of the mother, don't be disingenuous. if a woman wants to have a leg amputated, that although crazy in my view, is her right but, as you well know it we are talking about the life of a baby in the womb. the foetus has no choice in the matter, funny that the victim has no say in the crime. pro-lifers speak for the unborn babies, it is as simple as that. ps for an aussie, your english is quite good and i agree with some of your positions.
