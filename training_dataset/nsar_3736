oh no, a muslim killed a christian. i suppose we should totally get rid of the muslims in this country and ban them forever, n'est pas? nein nein nein! a christian does the same thing, kills some afghanistany, civilian or not, because they're ' the enemy' and he's a hero. because he's one of us, that makes it alright. 'but when them paki bastards come over 'ere 'n start killin' our boys, they can fuck off back to mussy land they can, yeah kill the bastards!' again, no, no no no no! learn to live with each other, this guy did something wrong, he should be condemned, not his whole religion. of course he did wrong and i am not just blaming the racists, it's equally the extremists fault. but all i am saying is, learn to fucking live with each other!
