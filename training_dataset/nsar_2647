I don't think that there are any marriage rights for anyone gaurenteed by the constitution. I believe that if marriage is offered to heteros, and they seem to think it is their right to get married, then marriage must be extended equally to gay people. I believe that one group using their religion as a basis to form laws that violate another groups religious freedom, with govenment support, violates the constitution.
