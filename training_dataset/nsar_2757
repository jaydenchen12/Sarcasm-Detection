Should we allow health-care to the homeless, and illegal?For the homeless:Yes. However, I think that it should be based upon how they got to be homeless. Because, sometimes, it's their fault. And in those times, I don't think that we should have to cover all of their health-care.DO I believe that we should cover some of it? Yes, because it's the right thing to do, and it is what our nation claims. Equal rights.However, I have nothing to say on the issue of the illegal, because a member in my family was recently attacked (stabbed) by one, and the wounds are too fresh, and if I speak on it, I will be speaking with prejudice, so I will leave that subject alone.But, what are your views?
