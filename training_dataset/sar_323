So the solutions to gun violence proposed by gun activists in this thread seem to be-1) More prison time. 2) More guns and have more shootouts between the bad guys and good guys. Yet, in other developed nations that have much lower rates of gun violence there are a lot less gun owners and people in prison. So are gun activists trying to sell people snake oil? "More than 5.6 million Americans are in prison or have served time there, according to a new report by the Justice Department released Sunday. That's 1 in 37 adults living in the United States, the highest incarceration level in the world."http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0818/p02s01-usju.html
