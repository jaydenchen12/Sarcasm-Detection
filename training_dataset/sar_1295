Well yes, Sarge but at the same time Accipiter indicated that we were preventing Accipiter and maybe others from having their opinions heard. I was just giving Accipiter his First Amendment Due. We all the time, get treated like we are the enemy, and we don't pay that any attention, because maybe to them, we are. However, it seems to me that when we treat them with the exact same treatment as they treat us, they cry foul! Is it a False claim of trying to claim aggrieved status? I think so, but I don't want to take the chance that Accipiter actually feels that way.So now Accipiter has an opening!
