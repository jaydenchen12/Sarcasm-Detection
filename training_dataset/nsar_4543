i fail to understand the fascination with mrs. kerry's wealth. george washington inherited wealth, including money and property. and then proceeded to marry the wealthiest widow in dc, who had far more wealth than george. the only reason i can fathom for people condemning kerry for marrying wealth is jealousy. all other things being equal, i'd take a well-traveled, multi-language, filthy rich woman actively engaged in various sectors of society over a dirt-poor librarian every time. (no slur on librarians, i know some who are fine people, including a wealthy one, just a comparison for the thread) as to mrs. kerry's tax filing extension, that's available to any and all taxpayers. all one does is pay the taxes due and request an automatic extension for filing. and that extension can, with reasonable cause, be again extended all the way into october.
