oh how arrogant, wikipedia is a grand tool for general information.  are you telling me that tiktaalik fossils, archeopteryx fossils and platypus don't exist, and that using wikipedia is somehow misleading in this sense?  these things do exist and i didn't think it necessary to cite peer reviewed material on such trivial matters.
