whatever 'rubber' was being exported probably ceased to be exported because of ravages of war during and after.Did you see any spike in the price of tyres, sorry 'tires' in the good old USA because of the Vietnam war ?natural rubber by the way is used mostly in big huge tyres not the size used in automobiles.Iraq was invaded to satisfy greed and ideology. American oil companies are still trying to get a preferential deal in their dealing with the Iraqi government.Now, what are the gringos and their lackeys (UK, NATO members et al) doing in Afghanistan, which has no oil, and no rubber? Are the gringos trying to protect and control the supply of heroin ? Myabe Saddam hid his WMDs (Weapons of Mass Delusion) in Kabul or nearby?
