As I'm sure you know, the Declaration of Independence states: "...all men are created equal, they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."Who or what do you consider to be the (capitalised) Creator in this text? More importantly, who do you think the authors of the Declaration considered the Creator to be?The Declaration certainly seems to tie up the notion of 'inalienable rights' with religion.No more, I'm going to bed.
