very nice propaganda, siegfriedson. why don't you tell us about the terrorist activity that necessitated military activity that inevitably caused also civilian deaths. the shooting of the 13-year-old girl is a terrible exception and i think the officer should be severely punished (i think he was).  the point is that israel tries to avoid civilian casualties whenever it is possible, hamas and other terrorists target civilians on purpose.  here are the reasons for anti-terror operations in the west bank and gaza: list of victims since september 2000 suicide attacks just since january 2004 (doesn't include mortar and rocket attacks that happen on almost a daily basis): tel-aviv feb 25 2005 karni crossing jan 13 2005 tel-aviv nov 1 2004  sinai (taba hilton) oct 10 2004  beersheba aug 31 2004  ashdod march 14  jerusalem feb 22 2004  jerusalem jan 29 2004
