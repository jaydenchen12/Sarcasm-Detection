yes, you are correct. i found that discrepancy and corrected my earlier post. i had not read far enough down in the original site to have seen it when i originally posted it. that's when i also was reading the other information that i linked. it gets curiorsor and curiosor. just a week or so ago fbi revealed that they had found more undiscovered explosives in the basement of mcveigh's accomplice. it's like a replay of the keystone cops.  i can't prove this but i suspect it is a lot of this information that is not widely shared and talked about that drove bush's decision to remove saddam. if in fact saddam were implicated in the earlier wtc bombing and of course he tried to murder bush #41, then bush had all the justification in the world to remove saddam.
