'so they don't really kill babies, they just put them in to a long sleep? is that what you mean?' no. 'and what does 'babies' mean? are you saying that unborn babies aren't really people?' yes, that's exactly what i am saying, and the science is behind my argument, not yours my friend. your personal, religious beliefs on the subject mean absolutely nothing to me. an unviable fetus is not a 'baby'.
