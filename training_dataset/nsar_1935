This is a good site, but very atheist I think. Do you know of a good theistic equivalent? I do not mean like those awful websites that misrepresent science to try and shoehorn the world into their Bible stories (sorry to pick on Christians here, but it is Christian ones that I notice), but ones that look at real science and look to see if a theistic explaination works for things?
