right now, i might consider it, as i am now a few weeks away from my graduation. back then, i would not, as i had just begun college (i was in my sophomore year for my bs - now i'm about to get my ms). however, there is also that other major part of my decision - i never had the intention to become pregnant, and we even took steps to make sure i wouldn't. that also is a major factor in any of my decisions on it.  another decision that involves my work is that from about my fifth month on (acording to the doctors i spoke with) - i would be unable to work - that's four months, and while right now i am in good standing with my company and they might even allow me to do that, back then i was just starting out, and would be unable to do so. so, i'd say that at the moment if that were to happen, and that i was paid a stipend (i know of no place near me that does so) and then gave the baby up for adoption, my fiance and i would seriously consider the prospect. i know that in the future - in five years or so - we expect to be able to have paid off all our loans, and we will then consider actually having a baby. so in summary - now i would consider it, but back when i had the actual abortion (6 years ago or so) i would not consider it.
