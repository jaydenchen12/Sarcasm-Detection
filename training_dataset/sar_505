The holocaust by the Nazis against the jewish people, was the genocidal elimination of an entire race of people who were indigenous to the country, betrayed by the very government that they believed would protect them. The jewish people committed no crimes, they were simply made the villain and wiped out by the government.Illegal immigrants are not indigenous to the country, are committing various crimes against the country and the people, putting us at massive risk, and doing parasitic harm to the nation. The law passed doesn't authorize their death, it just cracks down on them being here illegally.There's absolutely no comparison between what Germany did, and what Arizona is doing.
