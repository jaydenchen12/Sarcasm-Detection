emoticonXRolleyesNo. I am not saying that.Like I have been saying from the beginning, the right has been using Tea Parties and attempting to do two things off them...1) Exaggerate their numbers to make themselves seem bigger. FreedomWorks LIED about CBS reporting "2 million". Even Fox News puts the attendance in five digits, yet FW tries to pretend they are much larger.2) Pretend a uniformity of presence behind a rational banner, when the truth is that a LARGE segment of attendance sits behind a looney banner (like calling the president racist or Kenyan or secret Muslim or fascist / socialist / communist / nazi).THAT is my point.Or an even more popular one?The strawman argument!
