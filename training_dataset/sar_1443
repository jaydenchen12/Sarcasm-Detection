The Gun Control Act of 1968, which initiated the background check requirement, was written by liberal politicians; the main people who support gun control laws. It was these same gun control nuts that chose to intentionally not require private transfers to involve background checks.You missed the opportunity back in 1968, you have no room to gripe about it now. Shut up.
