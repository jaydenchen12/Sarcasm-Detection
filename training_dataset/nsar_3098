Though just in the case of an accident where maybe an older sibling had carelessly left one lying around, it is understandable that mistakes happen. I would simply continue along with the "scaled down version" and say that it's something such as a "gasket for sealing off biological contaminants". Now a response like this would confuse a child and go way over his/her head, though an adult could get a chuckle out of it, knowing the inside joke..
