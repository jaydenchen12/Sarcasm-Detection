god had two choices. he could make creatures that obeyed him completely with no possibility whatsoever of choosing against his will. or he could make free creatures with the choice to love god or not. can you imagine an interesting world where there are no choices? can there be love without choice? can robots love? because adam and eve chose to disobey god they were no longer perfect. all of history since then has been god's plan to bring us back to perfection. this is the view many christians have, hope it helps you.
