that's a false analogy. people who are sexually attracted to children harm children, and harming someone is a crime. homosexuals do no harm to anyone, and are nothing like pedophiles. and for someone who doesn't tolerate government intrusion, you sure seem to like government intrusion when it comes to interfering with marriage. huh? are we talking about gays or fornicators? fornicators being someone who has sex before marriage and gay being a man who is attracted to a man in the same way a straight man is attracted to a woman. lets stay on topic.
