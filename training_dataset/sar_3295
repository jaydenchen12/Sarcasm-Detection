wow. talk about mental problems in a can... not the issue. you claimed my signature isn't valid and proves nothing. therefore you must disagree with it. therefore if you disagree with it, you consider that christanity is the sole religion on the planet.  irrelevant.  you disagree with my signature. therefore you believe that every other religion except christanity is not a religion.  i suspect you don't actually believe this and you're just trying to cover up for your giant cockup. if you actually believed that christanity was the sole religion on the planet, you'd have no problem walking into a mosque or a synagogue or a temple and saying to all those believers that their religions don't exist.
