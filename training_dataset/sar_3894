you could go there but it won't change the fact i don't agree with your ideas of what is says. you believe it is saying one thing and i believe it says something else. we have an entire supreme court to do the same sort of interpretation game with our constitution. they sit and make decisions and interpreations based on what they think it says. the bible is the same game.
