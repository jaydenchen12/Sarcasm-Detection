You didn't mind commenting about God ('the Lord's prophets') just before I wrote my question above to you, so why are you running scared or bugging out now?Looks to me like you couldn't answer the question. So where's the beef? Answer the question?  Tell me how God creates mankind with free will but at the same time doesn't allow man to sin?
