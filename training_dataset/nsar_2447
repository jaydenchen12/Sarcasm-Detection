Abortions hurt much more than they heal. Not just phsyically (Side effects can occure months afterward) but psychologically as well. Guilt, depression, so forth. In my view, abortion is murder, one way or the other and rare extreme cases don't justify its legality. Even the rape victim gets a better chance than the baby does. They're at least alive while they kill their baby. That in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves.I believe these testimonies to be real, and I feel sorry for those victims who feel obligated because of family relations' reputations to kill their own child. It really is sad.
