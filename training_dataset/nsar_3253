I can appreciate this slant, however I think that a true feminist approach would be to support women who want their pregnancies by finding solutions to the reasons they feel an abortion would be their best choice.If we want to have a child, society should be backing us up on that. Instead, I see such a stigma for single mothers, I see single mothers unable to finish school, I see single mothers unable to work a decent job b/c of either lack of education or lack of child care, I see systems where the men don't have to support, violence, et cetera.
