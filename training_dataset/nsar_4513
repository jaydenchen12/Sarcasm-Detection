No, of course sexuality isn't strictly about behavior. The point is that religious belief about behavior is about behavior. Of course I agree with you about sexuality, but that is a different issue. The point is that it is not innateness that is opposed by religion. It is a behavioral issue. Saying something someone DOES is immoral is not the same as saying THEY are immoral.
