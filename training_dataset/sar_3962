Are you kidding? He's absolutely obsessed with the topic--and not just on this website. How hilarious! (For the record, in the 2+ years the poster in question has been on this site, he's posted more than any other user, even those who had several months head-start on him, the overwhelming majority of which are on the topic of homosexuality. And no, I didn't take the time to count them individually: just go to the members' list and sort by number of posts. You can also do a search by user name and forum, but the engine won't find more than 500 matching posts, and he's way over that on the Gay Rights forum alone. Talk about a definition of hypocrisy!)
