america invaded more countries, today has less freedoms (patriot act and so on), of all countries in the world germany is the only one, that hasn't a 'shady' history, cause everything has been come to light and regretted. the us still thinks ( your post as an example) it was/ is a force of good. no 'wiedergutmachung' of american history ( slaves,tortures, drones, dictators)
