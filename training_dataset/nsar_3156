The Washington DC city council has turned down ballot initiatives to allow the people of DC to vote on this issue (as well as some other issues recently). Considering the amount of support these initiatives appeared to have I think were going to see some new blood on the council soon. They have made some decisions of late that haven't sat to well with the people of DC, this appears to be one of them.
