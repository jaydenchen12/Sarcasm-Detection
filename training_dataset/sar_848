Ah yes the oldest con game in the world. Set up the game so its impossible to comply with the rules, then use the guilt effect to control the test subject. The Christians have managed to commercialize the whole concept on a mass scale. And even if a test subject thinks it has won the game and exhibits no guilt - there is always the mythical original and heritable sin to fall back on. In Adams fall we sinned all. Guilt is the father of ........ economic returns!
