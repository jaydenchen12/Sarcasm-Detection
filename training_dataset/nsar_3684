dude you need to realize this: if the claims i make are true, which i believe they are, then that means all the most crazy, outlandish, extreme conspiracies, are true. this is why society would have such a hard time believing it is real. not because they dont want to travel interdimensionally, but because it would mean believing in what those 'crazy nutjobs' believe in, do you realize this? all conspiracies are tied in to hide this one fact. conspiracy theorists never look that far back, but when you start looking that far back, it makes alot more sense.
