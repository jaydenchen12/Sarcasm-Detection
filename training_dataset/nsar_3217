The vast majority of proclamations and assumptions illustrating a cultural gap between science and Christianity, such as this post, are over emphasized and exaggerated as they focus on people who are expected to be out of touch (ie. People educated in the 40's and 50's when higher education was less common) or a very small percentage of Christians. Christians included in mass people of all academic backgrounds who find their paradigm consistent with their viewable (and non-observable) reality and by alienating them in mass by focusing on the minority of Christians you perpetuate falsehoods.
