I would say no.......I mean if you can believe in God, the you must believe that He's going to put what he means in the Bible. "He formed us from the dust of the earth...." Why wouldn't He put something else, like we evolved....don't argue that they wouldn't be able to comprehend that kind of science back then because you are limiting the ability of God.......
