Intelligent design is a recent concept (not associated with any one religion) and it hasn't had over 100 years to be studied. Why not start now? It can't happen if we block it from future generations. Why not give it a chance, study it, search for evidence, and offer it up for peer review? What are you afraid of? That it can mathematically rule out previous evolutionary theories?
