this is directly from their website: thousands did not die, this number was known to be made up.  see... http://www.catholic.net/rcc/loveboth/chapter27.html http://www.factcheck.org/article336.html the number of illegal abortions is also overstated...some estimate it is only around 100,000...considering 1973 only had around 800,000 abortions it doen't seem likely that a year before 1million were done illegally.
