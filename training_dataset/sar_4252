President Bill Clinton was very worried about Osama bin Laden well before 9/11 and HE GAVE EXPLICIT WARNINGS ABOUT OSAMA BIN LADEN AND TERRORISM TO GEORGE WALKER BUSH AND HIS PEOPLE DURING THE TRANSITION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIONS. Bush and his people blew Clinton off. Thanks a lot, George Walker Bush!
