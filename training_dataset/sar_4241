So, you don't judge! Then it's okay to lump all Christians together! Evidently, that makes it all better! So much for being a free-thinker. But then again, you never addressed the issue I asked you about slavery. You claimed to be moral, based on democratic ideals of moarlity... but democracy would have very likely continued slavery in the USA! It was Christians who aimed higher. I'm sorry if you want to talk past that, and say I disgust you.
