Nice try, but no cigar. It's been widely reported, even on liberal-run media, that states with 'conceal carry laws' have had a reduction in overall crime and more dramatic reductions in specific crimes like murder, etc.Myself, I don't worry with providing 'raw data' for lazy liberals who won't be swayed in their rabid hatred of 'gun ownership' anyway. Just keep believing Sarah Brady and the rest of those fools.However, you might want to read some of John Lott's stuff:http://www.johnrlott.com/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/493636.html
