Intellegent Design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms, and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset. It is based on the idea that if we can observe an organism or an organic function whose existence cannot be explained by the successive adaptation of the evolutionary model, then that organism or function is evidence for intelligent design. When intelligent design first emerged, among the long list of examples of irreducibly complex phenomena were the eye, the flagellum and blood clotting. All of these have been shown to have simpler counterparts which also fucntion, and therefore which could have been the evolutionary basis for the emergence of these more complex functions. These examples are summarized in wikipedia's article Irreducible complexity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
