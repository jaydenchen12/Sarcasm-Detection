The procedure is neither in the public interest nor that of the patient's. It's legal coercion inspired by religion. When my son was born I was "required" to listen to a 15 minute lecture on why circumcision was now a bad thing before I could have my son cut. I found it offensive since the lecture had nothing to do with medicine.
