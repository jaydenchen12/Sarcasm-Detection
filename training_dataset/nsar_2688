Umm...thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do.This is just pure intentional ignorance - you do realise Peddlar, that things can happen over time? Not to mention that evolutionary hypothesis have been made and then tested - protein homology for one, there is no way anyone knew the answer before hand but what was observed later when technology improved is what was expected. DNA dating pretty much gives the same time for common ancestors as fossils do.There is really no difference between carrying out an experiment a fraction of a second in the past and observing it than millions of years - other than the latter makes it a little difficult to get all the evidence sometime.Science is the current sum of human knowledge about how the world works.Never get published thoughThere is a massive amount of evidence that points to things being designed via evolution rather than a concious designer - there are massive amount of badly designed organs and organisms, either God is spiteful or incompetant. Lets not go into the parasitic wasps and hyperparasitic wasps which are what made Darwin convert (or part of it). He couldn't beleive that a kind benevolent creator would design such horrors intentionally. Having something's larvae consume your organs whilst still alive and feeding of another catapilar's guts whilst still inside them strikes you as a kind and good thing to do?
