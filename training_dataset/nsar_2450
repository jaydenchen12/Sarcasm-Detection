I wasn't thinking the term 'micro-evolution' but that does work.My point was that the idea of evolution is a gradual change over a long period of time. (I've never head the term "macro-evolution" (nor "micro-evolution honestly) but I assume that's what it is until you suggest different.)I guess the change in beak size is more noticeable than gradual. My point for asking the question was from the selection that you quoted. I point out what stuck out to me...What I saw was that if the finch are evolving a smaller beak because of the larger billed "recent immigration," than that is a fast change for when the idea of evolution is gradual change over a long period of time, unless I misinterpreted it. But then again, I think it's possible that "micro-evolution" does happen in some birds such as finches.
