i guess you're reading it wrong, then. back then, marriage was a commitment to one another and did not have legal meanings. that's just it. if you want to go by the original definition of marriage, like so many anti-gay people talk about, no one who gets a marriage should get legal benefits. however, they would never be willing to give this up, so by denying gays the right of those same benefits for the same commitment, it is just pure and unadulterated bigotry. by the way, look at post #9 to see what i think of the whole civil union movement.
