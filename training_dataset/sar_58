It's not just in case of an emergency. It's for everyday life. When I have to learn Spanish just to order a burger at the local Micky Dee's, that's a problem. Or when I'm trying to get some help at Wally World. So yes, I think that we need to establish a national language. "Should an English speaker learn to speak Spanish if they're going to Miami, LA or or other city where 99% of the language spoken is Spanish?"No, because LA is in California, which is in the US, and most of the US speaks English.
