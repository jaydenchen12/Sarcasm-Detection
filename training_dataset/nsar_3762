no only does the experiences one has make that person, but so does their effect on others. i didn't mean that only this and nothing else define a human being, i just used this on thing to justify abortion. this is an odd question, i mean, i can see myself saving someone's life if my stakes were relativly low, but to kill myself completely to save someone i don't know? i don't think so. would you, because i doubt it. of course they do.
