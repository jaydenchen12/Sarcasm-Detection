I think this is rather simple. There will be a decrease in volume or quantity of healthcare services. This will not include time of doctors who mostly tell their spport staff to do yet another test. So it will mostly include support staff, administrative staff, equipment manufacturers. They will not necessarily get paid less, there will just be fewer of them. Per person that is.
