C'mon guys!Leave poor Archie alone. The guy is mentally incompetent. Why pick on him? let him alone with his beliefs which he needs as badly as a man with broken legs needs crutches to move along.Without his beliefs poor Archie can not face life and even less death.So, of course he gets enraged when someone tries to take his carapace from him. would you do that to a tortoise? Of course not.I stopped picking on him and now I have only pity for him. emoticonXAngel
