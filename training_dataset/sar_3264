let's just cut to the chase on your spurious claim. when was the xivth amendment passed.? here is the enforcement provisions of the act of 1964: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_rights_act_of_1964 heller ruled that the 2a was about more than 'discrimination on gun laws' in that as long as the 'discrimination was equal it would be legal according to the plaintiffs and muncipalities'. that was ruled out and dismissed by scotus. you are building a strawman trying to imply i said your words. you are a poor liar. ad absurdum!
