I didn't attack either one of you at all. I just stated an ugly but very true fact concerning both your objectivity and your credibility. And regarding your sick hypothetical, it isn't a valid question at all as its based on lytes unproven third hand slander, so I see no reason to play a what if game with someone who only seeks to corrupt the truth rather than discover what it is. But nice try. emoticonXGood
