Regarding the Exodus passage: Why should men fighting each other, hitting a pregnant woman, and thereby causing her to miscarry or give birth prematurely (take your pick on which is the better translation) be considered "abortion" in the first place? It seems to me the position of the woman is rather different in the two scenarios!I'm not saying abortion is always morally acceptable, not by a longshot. But I'm also not saying it never is, either.
