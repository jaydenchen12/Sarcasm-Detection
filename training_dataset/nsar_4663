is? I don't recall abortion being illegal in china...in fact they have the most. China is a good example of what pro-choice thinkind leads too. I asked you to provide evidence that countries with abortion being illegal will have babies thrown in streets, you just provide me with countries that have abortion legal and babies thrown in streets, maybe you should question your position.
