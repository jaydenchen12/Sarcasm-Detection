.50 caliber rifles have been legal for ownership since the revolutionary days. they even had .75 caliber rifles. so why can't we have .50 caliber rifles today? i've yet to see any proof at all that a plane could be hit, let alone actually be blown out of the sky, with a single shot from the .50 bmg.
