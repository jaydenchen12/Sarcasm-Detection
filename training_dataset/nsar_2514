So, you consider a so called theory which allows a 10 billion year gap out of an alleged potential 10 to 20 billion year age for the occurrence to be the most credible theory? And is actually supported by the evidence? If they have any evidence, why the 10 billion year gap for wiggle room? No wonder you accept evolution as a rational possibility.
