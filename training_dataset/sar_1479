I just want to thank the Forum participants for making my Saturday quite nice. I am stuck by myself still recovering from Gall Bladder surgery and my wife is gone for a few days having to attend her fathers funeral. So today was made much more tolerable to me by this forum. The posts and debates were particualary interesting today and yesterday.Thanks all.
