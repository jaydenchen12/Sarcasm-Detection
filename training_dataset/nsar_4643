this is the root of the problem with the entire insurance based medical system. it is affordable and obtainable for those who do not actually need it, but impossible to get or unaffordable if you can. this is the heart of the debate. a lot of people find it morally unacceptable to let somebody with a treatable condition die in the richest country in the world for lack of care. at the same time in order for insurers to stay profitable, they need to not pay for treatment for people with expensive conditions.
