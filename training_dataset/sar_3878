just like god, i can only decide about you with the evidence i have available. everything about the way you act says i'm right; your protestation ring as hollow as a really, really hollow thing. (i never claimed to be a master of metaphor :) ) you never miss a chance to tell everyone that you're going to heaven and they aren't. sounds like someone boasting about their exclusive country club to me. there's certainly no humility in the way you present yourself.
