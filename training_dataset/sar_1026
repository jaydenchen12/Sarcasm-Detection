Your selective memory is at work again. As I recall, in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians. Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied, at first, by the government. Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which, ironically enough, is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops. In the end, the 'open and shut case' the government thought they had, blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses. I also recall, at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York, I think it was. There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton, I believe. There are a few other instances I'm sure.
