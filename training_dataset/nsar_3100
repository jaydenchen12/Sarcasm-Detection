But that simply isn't the case. Science class is for science, and any school receiving government funding should use it to promote real science, which is thinking. Until Intelligent Design can come up with evidence, as well as any potential advantage to the science community to ID, it will be nothing but a religious belief. And religion doesn't belong in the science class any more than politics does. A completely different subject which has it's merit, but not as real science.
