are you seriously claiming all christians believe this? even when i was a christian, i didn't believe all that. virgin mary? you gotta be kidding me. even as a catholic, that didn't make any sense. this creed strains credulity to the utmost, and i suspect you'll find lots of christians who don't accept it literally.
