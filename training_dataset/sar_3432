what party politics? calling people who want to hold bp accountable 'socialists.' mistakes were made, get over it. i've already pointed out the idiocy of attacking bp with a funny cartoon. you attack bp by focusing on its mistakes so that it can be held accountable by trial. if you just ignore those mistakes, it gets off scott free.
