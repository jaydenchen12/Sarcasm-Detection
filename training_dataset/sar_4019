read the article, it tells you who found the quote (site intelligence group). in any case, my point is would it matter? these groups are as likely to be pulling reverse psychology (at least in public statements) as anything else, i was pointing out the absurdity of using such endorsements to score political points. btw if you wanted to attack the source, you'd be far better pointing out that the poster, while posting on an extremist website, is not actually an al qaeda member or representative of any kind. rather than actually doing some research, you just put your fingers in your ears and claim the source doesn't exist.
