This is why I do not advocate the American Holocaust that has destroyed nearly fifty million unborn children on the altar of "choice"! Shadow's reasoning that "I'll have a baby when I'm ready" smacks of pure, unadulterated selfishness. I do not give a tinker's damn about the reason nor circumstances. When that child is conceived, all bets are off and the focus must be on that child!!!
