because people: can't admit their faults, can't tell others theirs, want to look good to their peers; and because people are selfish...i really find it pathetic...this is why i stopped lying when i was young, because i saw how much everyone else did it, and just saw it as pathetic, and didn't want to be like everyone else...i haven't lied in 1 year.
