nope, nothing wrong with fox news.  they haven't gotten things wrong('lied') more than any other news station.  while i will admit that most of the people on fox news lean towards the right, they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.  even if it was a bunch of right wing agenda(it's not) it would only balance things out a little. i mean, look at some of the other news stations.
