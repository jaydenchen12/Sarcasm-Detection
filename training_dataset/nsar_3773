good start. now the question becomes where did the stuff for the big bang come from? you see, this could go on for a while, because the next logical question is 'where did that stuff come from' and so on. no one could ask the same thing about a god. the god of the bible is supposedly self existent. one could say that about the universe, but given the big bang hypothesis, that does not fly. so now what? huck
