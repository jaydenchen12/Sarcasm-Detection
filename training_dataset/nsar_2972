I agree. Time will tell if the cells are as effective as embryonic stem cells, and it seems on the surface, they well might be.Except.These stem must be donated by pregnant women. Amniocentesis, while pretty darn safe, is not without risk.First, the pregnant mother must donate the cells.The risk to the fetus is not zero.When we already have a zero risk procedure from cells that are going to be disposed of anyway.In any event, I am sure some nut job with an extremely skewed sense of morality will find a way to call this procedure immoral in some way.
