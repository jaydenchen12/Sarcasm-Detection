Look at the fossil record. They say each level of earth represents millions of years....and these millions of years were necessary because it took animals that long to change via RM + NS -- and indeed it might. But heck, if variation is non-random, then it nullifies gradualism -- which nullifies the whole time-frame allocated for change in the geologic column. Then what?
