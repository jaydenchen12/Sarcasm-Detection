Without question my largest beef with God would have to be the fact that according to the Bible you need to believe in God in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven. The reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in India than if you are born in the US or Europe. The Indian culture is that of Hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the US and Europe which is primarily Christian. That means being born in the US or Europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a Christian and believing in God. Would the be at all fair if this were the case? My answer is plainly and simply no! It is idiotic infact. If God existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair. His system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you don't get into heaven. Furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to God's expectations. If not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way. God in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but I just don't see spelled out in the Bible.
