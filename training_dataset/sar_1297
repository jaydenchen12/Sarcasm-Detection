'white guilt is the biggest flaw in the american psyche', says dr. david yeagley, comanche indian source: comanche_patriot ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ white pride and white guilt today in the united states and most of the white world, as soon as a white child begins his formal education, he is implicitly told that he should feel guilt for the crimes of his ancestors. guilt for finding, conquering, enslaving, and killing off non-whites around the globe ... and littering in the process. this guilt stems not from his own crimes, but from the supposed crimes of other (dead) people of the same race. but the child is never encouraged to take pride in the amazing achievements of his race. more: white pride and white guilt ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ white guilt, obamamania, and the reality of race supporting obama for president, like supporting colin powell a decade ago, is seen by many whites as the ultimate in white guilt repellent. i don't recall ever meeting any white person who personally felt guilty for the troubles of african-americans. but i've known many whites who want to loudly blame other whites for black difficulties. more: vdare.com: 01/02/07 - white guilt, obamania, and the reality of race ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ white guilt = black power white guilt is best understood as a vacuum of moral authority. whites live with this vacuum despite the fact that they may not feel a trace of personal guilt over past oppression of blacks. whites simply come to a place with blacks where they feel no authority to speak or judge and where they sense a great risk of being seen as racist. one terrible feature is that it means whites lack the authority to say what they see when looking at blacks and black problems. political correctness is what whites have the authority to say about blacks, no matter what they see. it is a language of severely limited authority, of euphemisms that steer whites around associations with racism. the muteness that white guilt imposes on whites undergirds black power. it lets blacks live inside the silence of whites, and have our weaknesses be unutterable by whites even as they are plainly visible. messrs. jackson and sharpton are enforcers of white silence. and when whites are silent, black mediocrity is no deterrent to black advancement. everywhere that minorities press institutions today as groups, there is an erosion of excellence. the reason for this is that white guilt allows institutions to respond only with deference ‰ÛÒ deferring to the greater moral authority of minorities by lowering standards, and remaining mute to minority mediocrity, to save the institution from the racist label. so whites have made it socially virtuous to defer and stand aside as institutions erode. the public schools are all but devastated, universities are stunted by ideology, corporations are more unctuous than churches, the media are more unctuous yet, and american politicians ‰ÛÒ of left and right ‰ÛÒ speak in barren clichÌ©s about all of this when they speak at all. more: white guilt = black power ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ white guilt...myth or reality? shana attends a big 12 school and is always seeing white girls her age or younger propositioned by black men who get offended if rebuffed. she personally knows of one girl who had her entire social life ruined by a black man who called her a racist at a party because she would not be alone with him. 'he said something like, 'xxxx, you just won't be wit' me 'cause i be black'.' a hush settled over the crowd and a bunch of people looked at her like she was a pariah. the girl ended up going back home when all of her dormmates started harassing her for being a 'bigot'. white guilt is when a white person feels sorry for a person of color to such a point that they sacrifice their own rights, and often their own self-respect in a futile hope that somehow their action will atone for the real or imagined sins of their ancestors. arabs had slaves. as long as the slave was not muslim it was legal. arabs were even the organizers of the african slave trade to the west. yet there is no arab guilt over slavery. the romans had their entire economy powered by slaves. and often their own people were slaves. yet there is no italian or roman guilt. and the ultimate irony about the american slave trade was that many african tribes made raids on other tribes and then sold their human booty to western or arabic slavers, yet there is no african guilt. why white guilt then? one of the reasons is the media. more: queen of succubi presents white guilt fact or myth? ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever just recently, after declining a funding request from one of chicago‰Ûªs numerous beggars, i heard a most peculiar thing. the man yelled at me as i walked away: ‰ÛÏi‰Ûªm sorry i‰Ûªm not white.‰Û at first i assumed he was talking to someone else; then i saw that he wasn‰Ûªt. his tactic must have been an attempt to shame pedestrians into giving him more change. presumably, as the man did not look like a novice to this ancient profession, it must be a strategy that, with the exception of this occasion, works, which tells us quite a bit about the psyche of caucasian americans. more: american renaissance news: white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ‰ÛÓ the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade one of the many weapons which our opponents use against us, and also against others of european ancestry, is often termed historical white guilt. those who hate us point accusingly to our empire, and to our involvement in the transatlantic slave trade with the implication that we, particularly the british and european americans, are uniquely guilty of crimes against other races. they believe that, by making us feel guilty about our past, we will be less inclined to object to what is done to us on behalf of our alleged 'victims'. more: the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade | national policy institute here is an accurate depiction of white guilt at work every day in north america and europe. .
