Hey, let me jump in on this one.Creation science has found nothing. There are no ifs, buts or maybes, on this one. Creation science is wrong and has been proven so by the scientific community time and time again. Look at pretty much any post on this forum and you will see this. Every time a Creat brings up an argument, the secular residents of this site beat them down with logic and reason.No Creat argument has stood up to the test of science. Pure and simple.
