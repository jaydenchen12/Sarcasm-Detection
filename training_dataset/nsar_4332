I find it funny how a person can see how wrong it is to kill a baby after cutting it from a womb, yet they don't think it's wrong while the baby is still in it. That's what baffles me about Pro-choicers(Pro-abortionist). I wonder if there were a glass window allowing people to see what they are killing, if they would still feel no emotion.
