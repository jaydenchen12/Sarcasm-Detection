You want to restrict firearms ownership in a country on the opposite side of the world but are unwilling to as an average citrizen (sic) join this UN task force and do it yourself. You are willing to send the sons and daughters of your country on a foreign pirate raid but you won't lay your own life on the line. You sir are a coward.
