I am a Christian, so I believe that the meaning of life is to be re-acquainted with God and to live your life in according to his Word. Which, in my opinion is a far better life than: "I'm born of chance, I didn't ask to be here, I serve no purpose, so I might as well live egocentrically for the next 78.4 years until my life ends."
