The NY Times has a fairly good bio for Judge Roberts.http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/21/po...rtner=homepageOne quote in particular struck me:In his confirmation testimony two years ago, he said that judges should be "ever mindful that they are insulated from democratic pressures precisely because the framers expected them to be discerning law, not shaping policy," and added: "That means that judges should not look to their own personal views or preferences in deciding the cases before them. Their commission is no license to impose their preferences from the bench."If he holds to that belief than we could do alot worse. Unfortunately his tenure on the bench has been so short that it's hard to say if he meant that, or was just saying what he thought people wanted to hear.
