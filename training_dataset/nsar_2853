See the comments section on the blog entry I linked to, particuarly Stuart's own comments ..."Yes, you registered online, but the initial invitation was by invite only. You registered who was coming in your invited group, not just ‰ÛÏfirst come, first serve.‰ÛThere's a lot of discussion there on that issue. But it really doesn't matter--a private screening of a film is a private screening--they can boot anyone out that they want. I didn't say anything about anyone 'breaking the law.' I'm just showing you a different perspective of the events from a witness--you know, giving you MORE information from which to draw conclusions. Or did you only WANT your information limited to one version of the story, mainly from the account of the one who got booted?? I think it was simply a private screening, and the people running the private screening didn't want them there. That's their prerogative, as it was obviously a private screening and that's the way it works. Again, read the comments on the blog I linked to as they include comments from people who were there, including more from Stuart and at least one by PZ Myers himself.
