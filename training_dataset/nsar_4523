i find that laughable. is the state infalliable?  i disagree. at least 23 have been executed innocently, with rates likely much higher.  http://www.ucc.org/ucnews/feb00/current.htm how about the 69 released death row inmates? are you saying that in the past no one has been wrongly executed when we are now seeing dna and other tech freeing inmantes basically every 2 months?
