it is hard to believe that it won't draw attention away from everyone else. but everyone will get it and it will draw attention away from the families that are there supporting their kids...and the fact still remains that your goal is to influence (or show) the administration when it should be to give your child a good time.  when your purpose is to draw attention it is hard to imagine that it wouldn't take it away from the main purpose. think of it this way...you have 1 camera at the event...you hear about this 't-shirt' thing and all of a sudden the camera is not focusing on the kid tripping over himself to roll the egg but to gay parents wearing these t-shirts and them talking about how they are great parents. my question is...if you are such great parents why aren't you with your kid instead of talking to the tv camera about your personal message? i don't buy it anymore than if someone got a big group together and had t-shirts that said 'i chose life for my child!'.
