why am i not surprised at such an answer. people with no common sense nor the ability or desire to recognize the obvious need someone else to tell them what to think. you people can remain in denial of reality but we have hundreds of thousands of bars and clubs, both straight and gay throughout this country, and they are all packed to overflowing 5 out of 7 nights a week, every week of the year. if you actually think that the vast majority are there just for a drink with friends then you explain why we have millions of abortions each year by mostly single unattached women? where are they all getting pregnant genius, in church, at work and in school? emoticonxgood
