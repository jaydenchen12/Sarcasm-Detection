Hint: America doesn't "win" anything by staying in Iraq killing Iraqis. Real life isn't a videogame you're trying to complete.Hint: Using multiple punctuation marks detracts, rather than adds to your argument, by making you look like a raving lunatic.Hint: Strawman arguments, such as claims your opponent wants to "appease" (appease who?) simply look like the desperate flailings of a drowning man, especially when completely without context, as yours are.Stick to your religious principles and you might do better:But being American, she knew killing Iraqi children would be the right thing to do FOR TOTAL VICTORY FOR AMERIKA!!1!!
