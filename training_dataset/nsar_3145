i am new to the forum and was just reading through a few of the posts. i like archangel's line of reasoning here.  to take it another step, i remember reading in high school the percentages of, what elements made up the atmosphere. o, n, and about 2% of all the other elements combined. those 2% included co2 and had a number specifically attached to it. i don't remember what that number was, but if it were 'actually' showing measurable increases, why are we not all kept up to speed on how drastic the increases are? [i.e. 1970 it was 0.0123% and now it is 0.0124%]. i also remember at university there was a big deal about an aluminum plant in southern california or maybe mexico that was constantly blowing smoke into a particular mountain range that was growing trees. so scientists started studying the ill effects of all this pollution on the trees. does anyone know what was discovered?
