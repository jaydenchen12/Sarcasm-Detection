Second, in this very thread Arch has deliberately tied the two as one. There are at least three posts here where he has just done that. You'll notice right off the bat, despite a distinct clarification of YEC, and NOT Christanity as a whole, that Arch deliberately takes the discussion on YEC as a discussion on Christanity. Notice that the only person who argued the thread from a Christanity as a whole view was Arch. The rest of us deliberately stated otherwise.
