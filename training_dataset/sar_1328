Okay, here's the hypothesis I pulled out of my rear. Long ago, some females began to wear primordial shoes. The newly evolved shoe-wearing gene was selected for, as females with leather booties were less likely to cut their feet and acquire a deadly infection. This prolonged lifespan set up a selective pressure to develop a shoe fetish among males. Males who became attracted to the booties would be at an advantage, as they would more likely impregnate the bootie women who in turn would be more likely to survive to take care of their sperm products.Your hypothesis falls apart with your first statement.We all know that it would have been impossible for only " some " of them to have shoes. If one had them, then you can pretty much guess they all ... just had to have them.Now you make no inference to men having shoes. Here we can agree .... Women probably did invent shoes
