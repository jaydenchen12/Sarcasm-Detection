if that was all that i said then you might be right. i have spent a fair amount of time discussing the why's and wherefore's of my reasoning. and i did not say that good is god although he is. good does not define god. at least not completely. what i said was that god is good. god is the definer of good and he is good. i have offered a fair amount of analysis. i submit that you think it is 'too easy' just because you disagree with it. ef
