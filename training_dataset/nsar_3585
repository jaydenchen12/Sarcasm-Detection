'-illegal war in iraq.' whose illegal war? america isn't even there to be at war anymore! we are setting up a government for them! if they are grieving because we are helping the general public to live a more organized life then that's kind of their problem right?  besides; this isn't the debate topic where you should be bringing this up.
