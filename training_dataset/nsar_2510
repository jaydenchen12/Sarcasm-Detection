I think his point is paulie, that if evolution is actually as evo defines it, as changes made by way of random mutations, then why doesn't life reflect those random mutations? For example, why haven't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them?Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change, yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects, most every creature in creation has 2 eyes, 1 mouth, 2 ears, (if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator.)It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies. But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young. So why haven't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads?
