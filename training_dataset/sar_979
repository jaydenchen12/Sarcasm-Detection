You must be thinking of Behe. Dembski originally planned to be part of the trial, but when he realized that he'd be required to testify under oath, he backed out. In other words, he is unwilling to promote his view when he's not allowed to lie or when he will be required to answer questions he doesn't want to answer. Interesting, eh?
