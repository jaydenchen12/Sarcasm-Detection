the legalization of same-sex marriages (or marriage-like civil unions or domestic partnerships) would severely damage the public institution of marriage. it would send a false message that same-sex unions are equivalent to marriage, that same-sex relations and marriage contribute equally to society and provide equal potential for individual and social integrity, stability and happiness. it would convey the false message that whatever private sexual relationships adults choose deserve the same legal treatment as traditional marriages. legalizing same-sex marriage would create enormous conflict and confusion in the law and among legal systems.
