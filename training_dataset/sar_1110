I would like to point out that very few moms agive birth and then sit around eating bon-bons. Raising kids, doing laundry, running errands, doctors, PTAs, sports, cleaning, etc. And that is just at home. A great many of them work at a job, too - and pay money to support their kids, too - and some don't even get child support. Mine's ten and we haven't seen one thin dime.
