not if you injure them severely because that would be mighty useless if you don't want them to crawl with their bleeding hands in agony over their mangled, broken legs so they won't be able to work no more. then the punished slaves' agony will serve as an example for all the other slaves so they don't act defiantly out of line like the one you just punished. not to mention the child slaves... i've explained one times too many times why it's a sensible thing to do in ancient times. why is the bible worth defending again? it's worthy defending because you're just as much a radical as neophyte christians. i'll defend the bible from you just as i will defend the scientific method from religious idiots.
