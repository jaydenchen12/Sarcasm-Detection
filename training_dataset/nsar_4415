1) can you prove what you claimed earlier? you claimed that what i was saying was 'wrong', and then you proceeded to say that proving it was 'too much'... shouldn't you have to prove that claim as much as what i have said? 2) unlike you, i have been very upfront about the situation. at the start, i asked if anybody knew of a state that had removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement. since then, you have done your worst to obfuscate the issue. 3) what claim are you asking for proof on? please tell me that you are not asking for proof on the item in #2, cause we have both mutually stated something about the difficulty of proving it. if it's #2, then your request would be mundane and mindless. emoticonxfrazzled
