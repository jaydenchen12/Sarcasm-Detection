proof. give me proof that 'these animals' are the same citizens of iraq which we are attacking, occupying their homeland and adding an extra layer of tyrrany to an already terrorized, fearful country?  give me proof that shoving our fear and anger at innocent civilians is anything close to what is right or just.  we replace saddam hussain with george bush and the only real difference is that gb has never once set foot inside their country.  so don't give me that line that aborted fetuses are innocent in comparission. if you claim that a fetus is a life, what does it matter what type of life it is? human life is still human life.
