I was requested to start a new thread in which pro-gay and anti-gay marriage positions could be debated without posters being called "homophobes", "gay bashers" and "bigots" simply because they don't favor gay marriage.While I"ve already stated why I'm against gay marriage in previous threads, I'll reiterate them here for newbies and for simplicity sake.1. Gay marriage creates a new dependent class of citizen2. It is an unfunded mandate and therefore, illegal3. It forces additional costs on an employer via healthcare benefits4. It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody, property, inheritance, etc.,5. It allows more people to lay claim to finite SS and other entitlement benefits6. It establishes a loophole to transfer property without payment of inheritance taxes.7. It establishes a mechanism to bypass the payment of taxes on life insurance payouts.These should be enough fodder to get the ball rolling.
