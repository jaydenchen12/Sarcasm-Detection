i read it the first time. your are trying to argue that your experience was somehow unique and the way it happened excludes you from those who do what everyone else is doing. there is absolutely nothing in your personal story that is remarkable in anyway. as i said before just because you don‰Ûªt realize it doesn‰Ûªt mean that it is not influencing you to do what everyone else is doing. it happens to everyone including stupid arrogant people with an i‰Ûªm special attitude. your thinking is so screwed up that it precludes from knowing that. you really think your something special but you‰Ûªre not your just another brain dead clone.
