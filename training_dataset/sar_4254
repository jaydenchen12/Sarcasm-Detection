no, but abiogenesis does, and they are 2 sides of the same coin as they are presented as one process following the other. it is so deceptive and disingenuous to constantly separate them as unique processes while all the time knowing that one study is the scientific continuation where the other ends. you are playing a game of semantics in order to claim they aren't connected while all the while knowing that one study directly and specifically follows the other and build upon its claims as it continues on the explanation of how life evolved from single celled life forms. so stop with the denial and word games and face the truth for once in your life.
