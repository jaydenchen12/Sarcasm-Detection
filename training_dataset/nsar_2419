I would like to address the theory of evolution point-by-point. Since I do not want to misrepresent the theory, I have used an explanation of Darwin's theory from Gould's book, "Full House." On page 138, Gould states:1) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.2) Offspring vary among themselves, and are not carbon copies of an immutable type.3) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations. (We know that black folks have black kids; white folks, white kids; tall parents tend to have tall children; and so on.)4)If many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments. Since heredity exists, the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents. The accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change.
