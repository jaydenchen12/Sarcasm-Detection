for once i find myself agreeing with randomdude. i've been in a church of several christian denominations and never seen a 'holy' bible that was just the nt. i've never been to a church where all the sermons are drawn exclusively from the nt. and i know that most christians embrace things like the ten commandments, which are ot all the way. the ot is a prelude, it sets a backstory for the coming of christ, but things depicted in it (like original sin) are essential to the message of jesus; without the ot, the nt is baseless nonsense - well, more than it is already, anyways.
