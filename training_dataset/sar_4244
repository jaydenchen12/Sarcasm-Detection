but if he intervenes, then the events will have changed and were therefore not foreknown after all. the whole issue of foreknowledge would be moot at that point, and freedom of choice would no longer be there. i think people sometimes make the idea of forknowledge more complicated than it needs to be by getting into paradox and blame issues. it basically means that god knows what's going to happen before it happens. but he doesn't intervene in order to maintain humankind's freedom of choice. foreknowledge is not the same concept as predeterminism.
