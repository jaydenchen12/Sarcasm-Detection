That is not exactly true. There is written law going 2500+ years back and death penalty was not the most common punishment used. It was used only for specific crimes, while the most common practice was eye for an eye doctrine. At least until the time of the Roman Empire and their law.Lol, read your Bible more carefully next time. I don't know it in detail but well enough that I know your words are full of BS.
