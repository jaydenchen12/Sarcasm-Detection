i have been researching and reading for 2 hours and a half now, and have had a startling realization; god can hate. i thought he didn't, was positive he couldn't. it turns out i was wrong, and for that i apologize for making a false statement. i have to thank you for helping me realize and i have certainly learnt a lot the past couple hours. thanks again.
