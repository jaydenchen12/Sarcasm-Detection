There is nothing wrong with honest intelligent debate on this issue, but the anti-gun crowd don't bring honest intelligent arguments to the table. The only thing they bring is fear and emotion driven rhetoric without any factual basis.For example, just mention the low murder rates in Canada and Switzerland, where gun ownership is legal, and they scatter like cockroaches.
