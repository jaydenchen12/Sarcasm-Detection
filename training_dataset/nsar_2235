First of all, we are supposed to be introducing ourselves, not starting up a topic. But let me kill two birds with one stone here.Hi everyone, I'm new here. And I love to debate. I got kicked out of one debate, because I won the debate on linguistics, and the girl got mad, because she lost, and banned me from the froum. Hopefully no one here is as immature as that. But anyway, thats my story, I'm glad to be here. And I'm ready to debate. And here is my first victim.I'm against gay marriages. Why?! Because in order to mantain a healthy environment for children.(which they always seem to want to adopt) there has to be a healthy relationship. Now a child grows up, and sees two men/women dating eachother. That can confuse the child as to whether they should also be gay. It is not only harmful to the family environment, but also to society. And don't hand me that," My uncle is gay." Stuff. I had(he passed away) a gay uncle, have three gay cousins, and a gay aunt. Not my whole family is not gay, but it seems like I have quite a few in my family. Now I don't support what they do. Even though I love them because they are my family, I would not support them if they were to marry.
