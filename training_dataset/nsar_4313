iceland, new zealand, australia, and loads of other countries would just love to see us fall on our over bearing butt's. well good for iceland, maybe if more countries turn down our blood money , we can bring the troops home from the 120 bases they are stationed around the world. put them quarding our borders and growl at any body who even looks our way till the rest of the world forgets we are here. oops i forgot haliburton wouldn't be making money then.  can't have that so i guess we will just continue to be a nation of war mongers.
