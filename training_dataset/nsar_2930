so it‰Ûªs the scientific community that sets up communication within a society, and then the dumb old common peasants come along and screw it all up? hahaha ‰ÛÒ sorry but i‰Ûªm not convinced.  i‰Ûªm not ‰ÛÏin‰Û science, other than unwillingly contributing my tax dollars ‰ÛÒ however small the percentage is ‰ÛÒ to a social agenda of those who control the scientific community. i‰Ûªm permitted to have ‰ÛÏtheories‰Û about it. emoticonxangel when the word ‰ÛÏtheory‰Û is applied to a very wide range of subjects, it‰Ûªs not fair to label someone who questions one theory a rejecter of all theories. that‰Ûªs what the link in the opening post did ‰ÛÒ that‰Ûªs not rational discourse, it‰Ûªs not secular open inquiry, it‰Ûªs not a search for truth or knowledge. it‰Ûªs political/atheist rhetoric - look at the bottom of the page and whose name do we see? richard dawkins, what a surprise. and a quick google of ‰ÛÏedgar pearlstein‰Û shows a sarah palin hating atheist liberal just like him. emoticonxrolleyes science has a role in the control of the people atheists do, but it doesn‰Ûªt necessarily mean that they represent science. you haven‰Ûªt gotten in over your head ‰ÛÒ most who post here don‰Ûªt know much about science. tq doesn‰Ûªt, and of course he‰Ûªll tell you that i don‰Ûªt. there‰Ûªs a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel ‰ÛÏintellectually fulfilled‰Û, to discredit religion. some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn‰Ûªt written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. michael ruse and bradley monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. religious authors, practically too many to name. william dembski, david berlinski, phillip johnson, cornelius hunter, many others. you would do well to read anything by any of these people. far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like richard dawkins. he‰Ûªs become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. michael behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. read ‰ÛÏthe edge of evolution‰Û, or ‰ÛÏdarwin‰Ûªs black box‰Û sometime. :) some irreducible complex structures, but not all of them. for atheists, that‰Ûªs good enough. but it‰Ûªs not good enough for everyone. in behe‰Ûªs words; ‰ÛÏ‰Û_as biochemists have begun to examine apparently simple structures like cilia and flagella, they have discovered staggering complexity, with dozens or even hundreds of precisely tailored parts. ‰Û_as the number of required parts increases, the difficulty of gradually putting the system together skyrockets, and the likelihood of indirect scenarios plummets.‰Û behe wrote this in 1996, and since then it has only gotten worse for the atheists, no matter how much they dance.
