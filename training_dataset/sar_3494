i don't think so. i think everyone else is overcomplicating it. yeah, gays can't reproduce. survival to the fittest would indicate that gays should die off, but they are being helped along. if they weren't helped along and were told to rely solely on themselves then they would have no chance of survival. well if that's the way humans work then the gay island wouldn't do any better, unless of course you are saying gays aren't human. but i'm guessing what you mean is if the gays died off and the straight island had it's resources destroyed then the island itself would be worse off, but i was talking more about the people's civilization, not the island itself. sorry about lesbian island. it got hit by 2 earthquakes and a tsunami and sunk into the ocean.
