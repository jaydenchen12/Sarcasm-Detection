This is a major defeat for the Pastafarian Movement and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. If Intelligent Design Creationism can't be taught in public school science classes, then there's little hope for FSMism to be taught as an alternative. All we wanted was a little balance between science and faith and for that balance to be initially manifested from the bottom up, not from the top down, which has been the case ever since the materialists and athiests. . . .the athiest materialists for some time to come. . . .well, there's still Kansas.
