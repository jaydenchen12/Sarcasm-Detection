The Tec-9 was banned under President Clinton's semiautomatic weapon order some years ago and is no longer made, but the ones that are still out there can be legally sold."Gun Shows and ColumbineSame for North Hollywood. The weapons were legally bought at a gun show by an acquaintance and transfered to the shooters. The shooters then easily modified several to full-auto.
