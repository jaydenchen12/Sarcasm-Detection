First off this is not an accurate depiction of atheism. Atheism doesn't dictate how the universe was created or what happens after death. It just says that there is no god. Other than that it's up to you to think, use your brain. This is also why the thread title: "I don't have enough faith to be an atheist" is not accurate. All you have to do is believe that we weren't created by God. It doesn't in any way relate to evolution, the big bang, etc.
