I believe you said this a few days ago.Today it was revealed that the man the British police shot and killed on the subway because he did not stop as requested was a Brazilian who had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks in London.Spoke too soon ? ....this is what comes of having a smug european superiority attitude about the americans. If the British are doing this, lord knows what the French are doing out of the public eye in France !
