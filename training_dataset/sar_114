MRSA has been around a long time, and as a practicing Navy physician I have seen outbreaks in millitary populations for years. A 2005 study by the Navy Environmental Health Center that did not make any headlines showed that community acquired MRSA was present in 3-5 % of Navy recruits. There have been significant outbreaks in the SEAL training school in San Diego, as well as the Marine Recruit Training Depot, but this has not made the news. MRSA has also been a problem for years in hospitals and nursing homes. Now that someone has found a community outbreak in a gay population, it's "big" news ... bullsh!t.
