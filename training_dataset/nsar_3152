There is nothing about the theory of evolution that precludes a God. That fabricated idea is absurd. There is nothing about the theory of relativity, nor the theory of gravity, nor the theory that the earth is round that precludes the existence of a Creator God. In reality, God may or may not exist. Some people believe God exists. Others do not believe God exists. Neither view can be proven based on physical evidence. Both are beliefs only. Though one of those beliefs must necessarily be true.
