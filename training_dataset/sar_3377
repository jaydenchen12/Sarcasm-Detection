call it what ever floats your boat, but if the majority of americans don;'t want gay marriages, it ain't going to happen. the state has a right to set moral standards for the community. from my personal perspective, that would be an accurate statement, but as i said before i am one person with one vote. if nobody else shared my beliefs, we'd have gay marriage. but the majority of people in states with gay marriage initiatives, including my own state, don't want them, so it would be disengenuous of you to blame me for your pr problems. :)
