Think of how dumb and uneducated the "average American voter" is, and then realize that half of them are dumber and less educated than that. I would bet if we required a satisfactory score on a politcal knowledge test to vote for our leaders, we would see an entirely new crop of politicians in Washington. Ignorance is bliss, and by what I have seen on the news yesterday and today, there are an awful lot of happy people out there.
