__________________________________________________ _______________THE FOLLOWING ANALOGY IS PURELY HYPOTHETICAL, AND DOES NOT REPRESENT MY ACTUAL THOUGHTS ON CHRISTIANITY IN ANY WAY. I think Christianity is unnatural. I think belief in God is a disorder and sign of a mental defect, and the things they do behind closed doors, drinking "blood" and "eating flesh", ICK. It's a negative behaviour pattern that requires overcoming. That being said, I don't really have a problem with Christians, as long as I don't have to pay for their health benefits and pensions, not to mention all of their tax free enterprises. This whole dependent class of Christians is a huge drain on the atheist working population of the country and we should not be forced to pay for their benefits, let alone to recognize them as being equal. It's clear to me that they should be denied these benefits due to these "facts". __________________________________________________ _______________
