apparently, these "underlying preferences" are of absolutely no effect, since the psychological conditioning  of the individual overrides any other "built-in" trait factor. therefore these "built-in" trait factors are useless in practicality, because nothing about the individual's identity is influenced by them. so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist?
