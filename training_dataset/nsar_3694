we are all entitled to self-defense, but not all that is legal or moral is advisable. i am not against gun rights, or for the mad-regulators of the left; but if i were zimmerman right now (assuming he is telling the truth) i would be kicking myself now until the day i die for not carrying pepper spray and trying that first. for investigating further when the police told me to keep my distance. for not telling martin i had a gun and i was willing to use it before he got close enough to knock me down. i agree there is plenty of possible damning evidence either way. one piece that would change everything is if zimmerman threw the first punch; in which case trayvon would be defending himself and maybe zimmerman shot him because he was losing. that would not contradict known facts.
