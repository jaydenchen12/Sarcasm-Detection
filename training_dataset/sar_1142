Hmm ... a sheriff who actually enforces the law? Imagine. What I don't understand is why Democrats don't love this guy, given that regulation is such a big deal to them. It just goes to show double-standards.And Arizona, with it's REAL governor who stands up to the feds, is a state many others only WISH they could be.
