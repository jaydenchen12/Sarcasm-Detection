No, that logic doesn't hold Biblical mustard (or is it muster?!?!?!).Remember when Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross, and all kinds of people said things like, "He who saved others, come down off the cross and save yourself, so that we might believe" (that's a paraphrase). Well, Jesus Christ didn't come down from the cross and save himself: he allowed himself to die. Allowing himself to be banned from an internet discussion form seems trivial in comparison.So I'm starting to believe that the poster here named Jesus actually is Jesus Christ! emoticonXAngel
