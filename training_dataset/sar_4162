since reverend hellhound insists on using an antique definition of 'well-regulated', i think it will be interesting to examine an antique definition of 'the people'. the founders defined 'the people' rather narrowly.  john adams explained that women were not part of 'the people' because 'nature has made them fittest for domestic cares' and women were unfit for 'the great business of life, and the hardy enterprises of war, as well as the arduous cares of the state'. servants and those who didn't own land were also not part of the people because they were 'too little acquainted with public affairs to form a right judgement, and too dependent upon other men to have a will of their own.' (works of adams 9:375-378)
