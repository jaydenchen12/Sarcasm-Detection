i'm not going to argue with you if he does or doesn't. you'll have to take that up with some of the people in the gay rights movement. my point is that many people who have fought for human rights claim religion as part of their inspiration, and with your all-or-nothing approach, i can only assume you'd still condemn religion even if gets more and more gay friendly. so i find it odd you'd even bother to indicate any distinction.
