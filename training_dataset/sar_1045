You needn't be far left to support reasonable gun regulation.What current firearm related issue would drive an "anti-gunner" to commit a terrorist act?Or are you just lumping anyone who supports gun control in with PETA and radical environmental groups?I'd be watching for the next murderous domestic terrorist to come from the ranks of those sporting teabags. Wanna place a little wager?
