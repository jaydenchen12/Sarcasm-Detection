i can see your point, though i am confused about gay sex drive, your saying a gay man's sex drive is not feminine? is it reasonable for a heterosexual to want to avoid close contact with a homosexual under certain conditions? like being naked for example? there are gays that go to my gym, am i being homophobic if i purposely avoid showering with him? i can surely pick my friends; naturally my interests would hardly mirror a homosexuals interests. some are even quite feminine and would hardly be interested in the same subjects as me. is it reasonable for me to be selective about whom my friends can be?
