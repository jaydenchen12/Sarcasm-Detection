Often abortion supporters convey their message as one of championing the cause of freedom of choice and resistance of the oppression of others values on women. Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for "choice" remains consistent.Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children? Do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of China for example? The woman's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her. Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children?There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children (there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy). Do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice?Or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples?
