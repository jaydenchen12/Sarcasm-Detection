Once again this only confirms my belief that republicans are evil and celebrate gay oppression.http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/06/062007yorkmar.htmWe even have one quote.So it seems that gay people and our families are to remain 2nd class citizens to preserve this evil mans heterosexual privledge. How is it that "the way he was brought up" is more important then protecting gay people? What of they way gay people were brought up? What about the threat to our freedom that Brian Kolb and his evil religion and political party represents? I was brought up by my father, taught in school that all people are equal. His refusal to extend marriage to gay people is a threat to me and I do feel harmed and it is a challenge to the way I was brought up. I do live in Michigan and not in New York but his evil statements and attitude are the same here if not worse. I was shocked to find out the Romney was the son of a former Michigan governor and that he is from Michigan. Does figure with all the anti gay religious nut cases that are swarming in the woods here in Michigan.
