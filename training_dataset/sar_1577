As a matter of fact, I find those to be a HUGE turn off. If I wanted a penis, I'd be with a man. I don't want a penis, I want what I have. My wonderful, loving female partner. Who is my emotional equal, my life partner, my best friend and my worst critic. And trust me, there is no man who could ever make me feel the way she does.
