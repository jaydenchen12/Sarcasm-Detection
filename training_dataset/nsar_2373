I have read the opinions and conclusions reached in several internet entries and I can see how they would largely persuade someone to think that the side-by-side dinosaur and human prints in stone do not exist. However, before you reach a personal conclusion, I would really recommend you visiting the site. Awe is not strong enough to describe the feeling that overcomes you when you personally witness this. I have been there and felt the chill when I saw what could only be prints of very old humans co-existing with dinosaurs. There is hardly a rebuttal that works when one is personally exposed to such an odd and even eerie site. The heel marks are clear as are the arches and in many instances, the toes. Before the naysayers offer a rebuttal, I think a visit to the Paluxy River around Glenrose might be in order. When you do, I think you will agree that there really is nothing like it. You might even revise your opinions regarding order and origins of life.
