I too believe that abortion is murder, however a) bombing a clinic involves the chance of killing other people - what about the postman delivering a package to the clinic. b) there are, in these cases I believe, other means of 'protest' c) if you do protest you should also be willing to support women who choose not to have an abortion... responsibility on this issue goes much deeper.
