well, i apologise to both you and ez, but i must admit i am a little biased. though this is mainly due to easy rider tending to rely a little heavily on unexplained gospel quotations as argument, without any consideration for alternative meanings or possible context. though i realise this in itself is predisposing me slightly (maybe significantly) to one side, i think it is important to be able to argue your point from the opponents side if you really want to convince or convert someone.
