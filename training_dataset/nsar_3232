The problem with ID is that there is no evidence, and it is simply not possible to falsify it. If we were able to prove that our dating procedures were false and that really we stood on 2 legs back when the Earth was created and that the fossil record is not really as we thought it was, evolution would be falsified. Intelligent design can simply not be falsified because there is no supporting evidence for it. That is the line between religion and science.
