The more we seek to redefine marriage, and chip away at God's original design for the home, the more we put our families and our nation at risk.How do you know what God's original design for the home was? How do you know that God didn't create homosexuals for a reason (i.e. helping raise children of people who can't care for them)? How is allowing 2 people who commit to love eachother for life putting heterosexual families and the nation at risk? At risk from what?This debate about gay marriage is really just the latest outgrowth of a culture that for decades has been drifting from biblical standards of truth and morality. The sexual revolution, for example, sought to bring legitimacy to sex outside of marriage. The women's liberation movement worked to revolutionize the roles of men and women in marriage and in our society. Throw in a rising emphasis on materialism and personal happiness, and you end up with a dramatically new way of looking at marriage.When millions of Americans view marriage from the mindset of ‰ÛÏWhat's in it for me?‰Û concepts like responsibility, self-sacrifice, and lifelong commitment become secondary. Is it any wonder that our divorce rate is so high? Or that the number of children born outside of marriage continues to rise? Or that an increasing number of couples are opting to live together instead of marrying?And now the push for gay marriage seeks to redefine marriage even further. From the moment God created marriage, it was designed with a man and woman in mind. God designed two sexes male and female‰ÛÓHe did not create four sexes. Homosexual marriage cannot fulfill God's purposes for marriage.I realize we are not all Christians here. However, this issue of gay marriage transends all of society and it will have a negative effect on all of us. JMHO.
