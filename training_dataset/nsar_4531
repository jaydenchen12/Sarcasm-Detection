i know more about human nature than you do. i'm beginning to not see much point in continuing this argument with you either, because you just can't seem to understand the fact that mr. horn wasn't found guilty of any wrongdoing. if you don't like it, take it up with the grand jury. maybe this is good publicity; don't come to texas if you have plans to be a criminal otherwise you'll get shot and the person you tried to rob will be hailed as a hero. that's the kind of message we need to be spreading; be a criminal and die like a dog.
