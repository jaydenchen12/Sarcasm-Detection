is there more? yup! i was referring to your outright statement that there was 'no liberal party' when indeed there is one almost in every country. you paint with a broad brush and don't have a clue what the color happens to be. i don't suppose you need to be a member to be educated enough to realize the different parties even though you claim to vote and the parties are listed on the ballot? in other words, your imagination is your guide? that will serve you well emoticonxrolleyes
