It would be bad enough if it was just the teacher chewing gum and telling the students don't chew gum. But it doesn't stop there. The teacher makes the rule no gum chewing in class. Then later that same day she instructs Billy and Sally to chew gum. Johnny sees this and decides to chew gum too, thinking that its ok. Of course, he gets expelled from school for breaking the rules. In this case the teacher isn't just breaking her own rules, she also commands some of her students to break the rules as well, yet still penalizes those who break the exact rule if they weren't commanded to do so.
