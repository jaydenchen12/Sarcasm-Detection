a little lesson in biology told me that when the sperm meets the egg, it makes a zygote... that means that fertilization has occured... which means a life has begun (even the medical field and our government agree with this). thats an embryo... a human being... a sperm cannot in and of itself become a human being unless it meets the egg.
