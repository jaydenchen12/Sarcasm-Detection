so stop blaming his actions on the right side. a better question. why exactly was this guy not committed to a mental health clinic if he had displayed clear and present danger to himself and others as early as college? he was kicked out of college for being disruptive, he wasn't qualified to join the army, why wasn't he committed? why is it that nobody, not even the liberals, decided he was dangerous enough to drag before a court, determine him mentally deficient, and then lock him away for the good of society? i'll be sure to let the military, police, fbi and secret service, know that you said they're all cowards for being armed.
