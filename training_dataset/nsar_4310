simple: there was no copying. only a fool would expect a definitive answer. congradulations on finding a source. now, what is wrong with this: 'first, it cannot explain the differences among the writers' in that source? i can't tell that since you ripped my answer out of its context. you'd have to have proof that that is what occurred. and you can't. and why? it did for 1700 years till non-believers came along.
