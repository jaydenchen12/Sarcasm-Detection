imo, your third degree about 'freeing willy' throughout this thread qualifies as the former. of what concern of yours is it that dono or anybody else for that matter was circumsized, circumsized their kids or believes in circumsism? i was circumsized, my son was circumsized, he'll probably have his son circumsized. i can guarantee you that no generation of my clan will ever mourn the loss of their excess foreskin. as far as we're concerned, it's dead weight, excess baggage. all it does is hide the purple helmet. emoticonxbanghead
