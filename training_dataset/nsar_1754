Consider an extreme literalist, asked to put the two Genesis accounts side by side and then asked, "according to the two accounts, on what day was man created?" Everyone not a literalist can see that the two accounts conflict when read literally. But I've known literalists say, "I see no contradiction" - and they meant it.
