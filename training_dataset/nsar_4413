true. it would have to go through the lower courts unless 'fast-tracked'. scotus could rule that ffca isn't applicable because it is a license issue and not a statute. that's the sad state of affairs that exists today. we can't depend on the scotus acting in accordance with the constitution. emoticonxmad  imo, the creation, by an activist scotus, of a phantom right is more dangerous than the loss of that bogus right. if we had a scotus that foillowed the constitution and didn't dabble in legislating, i wouldn't be fearful of 'big brother'. there are 'real' safeguards to protect us from that possibility, so we don't need scotus to 'make up' new ones.
