You still haven't showed us where he is a self proclaimed Conservative Christian rather than just a conservative republican OP. Would you care to support that claim with actual evidence or is it your intent to once again just lump everyone on the Right into the same pot of Funamental Christianity so as to slander us all as a group ? Is that your idea of fair and honest debating ? Some might take lies about them as personal slanderous attacks on their character and respond in kind. I thought you believed in elevating the quality of debate to being intellectually honest ?
