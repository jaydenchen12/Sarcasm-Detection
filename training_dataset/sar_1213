The problem is that you have wack jobs and zealots on both sides of the issue. On the one hand, you have the YEC/creationist crowd. Some fo them go off the deep end when you suggest anything but a literal interpetationof Genisis. On the other side, you have the evolutionaist crowd, who predict gloom and doom and a return to the middle ages every time you suggest that we leave some opening for kids parents to attach religous connotation to the issue.
