peter was obviously there are more writings of peter apart from the gospel of mark and 1 & 2 peter you find in the bible.... you will discover it is not only the bible that the church use for their deposit of faith but a number of other writings regarded as sacred tradition. it was peter and the apostles who had influence over paul not vice versa. if peter and the apostles influenced paul and peter had primacy among the apostles obviously it was peter who influenced the church not paul, since paul was influenced by peter!
