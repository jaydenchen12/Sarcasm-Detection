tsk tsk. on the iidb board, you insisted that if an animal was transplanted to a different environment, you would expect it's phenotype to change in response to that environment within 'a few' generations. a few is generally taken to be around three (much less than 12 anyways. that is what we call 'a dozen'). oh, and strawman, again, does not mean what you think it means. please answer my question.
