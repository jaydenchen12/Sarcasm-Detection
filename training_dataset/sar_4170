jesus didn't come the first time to throw stones, but to save the lost. but the second coming and the final judgment are different stories.  'and i looked, and behold, a pale horse! and its riders name was death, and hell followed close behind.' - revelation 6:8 beware of what you say about jesus because i guarantee you it will come back to haunt you.
