I keep hearing gays say that but every time it's put to a vote, you lose. I'd say that it's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition. The only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action. And when they respond on the ballot, they do so punatively.Just wait until you see the repercussions of the current efforts to give ALL Federal Employee's same sex partners bennies on OUR DIME despite DOMA. I'm guessing that some additional Democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies.You need a PR strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over bathhouse and gay bar existences. I believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but NOT marriage. And I count myself amongst that majority.
