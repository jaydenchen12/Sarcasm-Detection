I'm not advocating passing handguns out at the front door of school. Surely, in high schools and colleges there could be found several Batman types who would be proud to protect the general public from mentally deranged gunmen by carrying one himself...just in case.If it would save a bunch of lives by having a quick way to snuff out random shooters, I'd be all for an extra tax to cover it...and I hate taxes.
