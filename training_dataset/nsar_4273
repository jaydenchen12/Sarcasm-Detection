i have had to really change my point of view of how people (male and female) look at life lately, greg. although i can see your pov, i also see a growing defeatist attitude, at least area-wide here. that is one reason i changed my custom user title, which means: life happens live with it. why the despairing attitude? hopelessness, i thinkwhere that comes from i have no idea.
