actually, i know a lot of homeschoolers that went to my church. they are all very very socially incapable of doing much of all. i'm sorry, but thats how it is. i know almost as a fact that they would be much better off if they were not protected by their parents and allowed to live in the real world. maybe you are in the minority.
