There doesn't have to be a defined "shot calling" leadership of it any more than there has to be one in Judeo Christianity. The two are actually comparable - Christianity gets its leadership/organization through Biblical reference and church leadership. Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins.
