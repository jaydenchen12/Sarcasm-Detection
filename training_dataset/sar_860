I repeat in rebuttal to the ignorant, bigoted and hateful response above. Not to mention anti-american, prejudicial and irrational justification for attempting to deny free americans of their right to vote for a legally held proposition to amend the California Constitution according to the rules outlined in the Constitution of California. And for comparing Americans who simply voted, with Nazi's who more resemble your groups tactics, than the LDS community.
