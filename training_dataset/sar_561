A computer never does anything but what it has been told to do given a certain stimulus. Any real "decisions" were taken by the programmer. Once a certain set of preconceived conditions are encountered, then the machine does what it was told to do if it encountered those conditions. The computer never makes up its own options and chooses its own preferred course of action.
