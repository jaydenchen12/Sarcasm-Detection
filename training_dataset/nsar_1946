the classic anti-gunner misinterpretation. what i'm advocating is that we stop this naive belief that we can save lives by banning guns on and around school property, because the victims of columbine and virginia tech will tell you that this belief is wrong. despite this inane fear that so many have, there aren't going to be shootouts between students and teachers over a d- term paper. how do i know this? because the people that have permits to legally carry guns aren't murdering each other over dented fenders, parking spots and disagreements over which football team is best. furthermore the 1,000 foot gun free proximity zone around the school is totally useless. it does nothing to ensure or promote safety, it's just a big inconvenience to people who live near a school, and a potential trap to anybody who's traveling to or from the local range. should you really be guilty of breaking a federal law by simply having a gun while being 999 feet away from a school, while your friend who's 1,001 feet away from the same school, with a gun, is completely innocent and not facing felony charges? the intelligent answer in this case would be 'no'.
