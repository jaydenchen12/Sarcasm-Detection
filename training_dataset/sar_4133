what bothers me the most about 'organized religion' is the sheer hypocracy. i was taught that god instructs us to question authority, yet 'the church' brainwashes it's mass followers to not ever question authority, especially theirs.  i was taught that to not utilize the brain i was given was the unspoken sin of all sins. yet organized religion forces it's followers to do just that, to not question authority, pooh-pooh science, and never think for themselves let alone following their hearts.  i cannot of good conciense as a parent allow my child to be subjected to that type of abuse. spiritual abuse, abuse of the soul. how dare anyone expect me to do that to an innocent child? how dare anyone allow this to continually happen, even encourage it's existence is beyond compassionate comprehension.  but the fact that it does isn't shocking, it's just sickening.
