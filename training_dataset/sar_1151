Why don't we just ASK women who've had abotions...that's all the proof you need! I have been reading stories of women who in their own words talked about their abortion experiences....even the ones who claim to be pro choice and still are after the abortion make statements of lingering feeling guilt and regret over having it done as well as nightmares about it. If it's really no big deal, then why would they feel that way?
