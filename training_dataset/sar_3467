it is not the existence of the gay people that moralizing families question. their opposition to them being in the video is not based on that. their view is that it shouldn't be considered a 'family' in the acceptable sense of the term. not that they exist. surely you know this. now, you and i don't agree with that, but the question here is whether or not the school should teach about issues that moralistic ones in peoples' minds, such as this one. imo, they shouldn't. there is a broader issue here. so you think censoring over the issue being a moralistic one is ridicuous, eh? so you'd have no problem with schools teaching that people should go to church? or that male kids can have more than one wife at a time when they grow up? those too are moralistic-based issues to many people.
