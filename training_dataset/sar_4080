do you have any children? i have three. i've seen the sex ed classes that they've had. they don't exactly teach abstinance only, that's for sure. whatever. you presumed to know what i want and when told what i did want, you continued to presume. i can't cure terminal cluelessness. not at all. many european countries have had free access to abortion for way longer than the us. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1869009.stm their abortion rate is probably lower because ru486 has been available there for much longer than it has been here.  http://www.medicationabortion.com/mi...ne%20worldwide it's quite likely that the statistics are skewed by the use of ru486 and plan b, also.
