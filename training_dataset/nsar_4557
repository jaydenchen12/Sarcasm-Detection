morality, in the strictest sense of the word, deals with that which is innately regarded as right or wrong. the term is often used to refer to a system of principles and judgments shared by cultural, religious, and philosophical concepts and beliefs, by which humans subjectively determine whether given actions are right or wrong.  you do know the difference between right and wrong don't you? i see no reason teachers shouldn't play a part in attempting to teach pupils the difference.
