pot ... kettle ... black emoticonxrolleyes once again i provide a friendly reminder of the op's original 'subject matter' and thus the essence of debate in this particular thread. i've even taken a moment to highlight the questions the op wishes to address. if you dont want to address the arguments then that is of course your perogative. why would you waste your time discussing consequences of certain actions if you find them irrelevant anyway? even if it does contradict your ability to do so in other threads. :)
