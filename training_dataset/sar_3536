how should i respond to coming back after some time to be immediately called chisler, con artist, stupid? nevermind my observation that left to your own devices, days go by where you either follow up your own posts or pat each other on the back as you regurtitate canned anti-gun control rhetoric. i calls them as i sees them.  you might recall that initially you pro-gun guys rejected even the suugestion that american semi-autos would be of any interest to the cartels when they could get full autos on the black market. how then do you attribute the fact that 70% of the rifles seized in reynoso last november, the biggest single seizure to date, traced to the us? that's why i posted that story. that's my question for you guys. apparently they have some use for semi-autos afterall.
