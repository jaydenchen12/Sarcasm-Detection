did you watch the video? this is not about liberals vs. conservatives. the argument is that a childs success is not by any means proportional to the sexual orientation of its parents. mr. wahls is an example of that. good parenting and luck is what's needed to instigate success in a child. you seem to insinuate that is done only by 'liberals' (man, i hate that term). this is simply rhetorical analysis 101. pathos to be exact. you appeal to a persons emotions. it's a marketing ploy used by advertisers and politicians and is not particular to the left. i assume you're describing the up your alley sections of that website which is hardly representative of the entire homosexual community.
