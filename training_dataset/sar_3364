the question is why did you change the sentence? as has been said, the thermonuclear reaction taking place in the core of the sun is not mentioned in the theory of evolution. so, you managed to make the first sentence of your 'proof' complete and utter rubbish. not a good start then. some other questions i would like answered about your 'proof' would be: why is it assumed that the nuclear reaction taking place in the sun's core would be perfectly linear? from above, if the sun's life is around 10 billion years, why would 4.6 billion years be its half-life? do you know what a half-life is with regards to nuclear reactions? that's just the first paragraph. if you can answer them satisfactorily then i might get onto the rest of your 'proof'. smiley
