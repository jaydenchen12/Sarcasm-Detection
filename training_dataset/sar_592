There you go again, conflating questioning with disobeying.Da*n right you should question the cop who pulls you over."When was your speed gun last calibrated?" is a good question."Are you sure you got me and not the truck next to me?" is another one."Were you in a position to see both my car and the stop sign?" is #3.Do you know the law on where at an intersection the law requires me to stop?" is #4."Is your speed gun accurate on a curve?" - #5Oh yes, I have LOTS of questions for any cop who stops me.No tickets in 35 years have stuck to me, and I have had fun making horses' a**es of cops in Court!!
