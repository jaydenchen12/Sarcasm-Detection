Let's get real here. The man puts out fires and rescues people. Do you really think he's going to stop and ask people before he carries them out of a burning building "wait . . . are you gay? Because if you are I'm sorry someone else will have to do this." This idea that someone's political and/or ideological view on a public referendum issue should have any bearing on whether he should be allowed to do other things is scary, if you ask me. It's stepping into the realm of thought-police fascism.
