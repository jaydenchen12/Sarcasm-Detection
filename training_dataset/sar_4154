i think we should go to war with iraq. we know they have weopons of mass destruction. he has 16-17 weapons of mass destruction, this violates code 1441. some people don't want to go to war because they don't like it. no one likes war but you got to do what you got to do. others (even though they wont admit it) doesn't want to go to war just because bush says we need to. theyll do anything to rebel against bush.
