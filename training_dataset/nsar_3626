you make a great point, one i had brought up to my state senator as well. i asked him if he had ever been sued for not hiring anyone for any reason. his reply was that he had not, granted it was punctuated with stammering and stuttering as he answered. i knew i had hit the nail on the head and caught him off guard. he had no response. yes, i'm sure it was just his excuse for maintaining his personal bigotry against gays/lesbians.
