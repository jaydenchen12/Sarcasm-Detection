Those who object to same-sex marriage primarily (or so they claim) because it would "change the definition of marriage" should perhaps be made aware that that train has already left the station:Merriam-Webster On-line http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/marriage Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/marriage Encarta http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/featur...fid=1861628509 American Heritage http://www.bartleby.com/61/2/M0120200.html This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects. (By the way, the above entries also include the typical "husband and wife" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)
