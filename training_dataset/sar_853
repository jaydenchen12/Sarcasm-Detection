Would depend on how sucessful they thought the handing in was, but don't you have to register for a leicence? So all legal owners are know already and can be checked off against the guns they have handed in, I would imagine that there must be departments of the police who deal with tracking black market unregisted guns so these could be cracked down opon. In addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal, then you have to balance defending your property with revealing you are commiting a crime (will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene). Would also have to look at countries that have carried out sucessful ones to see if there are any little points or mistakes to pick up.If there is a lot of resistance you could make possesion of a gun attempted murder, would make people think very carefully whether they would want to carry them, especailly criminals- comunity service or light sentace for a mugging or long term prison sentance for attempted murder if they are carrying a gun while doing it, even in bank robbery they would likely think twice about the additional years.
