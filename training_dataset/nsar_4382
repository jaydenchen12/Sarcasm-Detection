i don't think so.  sorry, that's not a biblically-based nt christian moral. that's justice, and it's perfectly legitimate according to romans 13.  bad morally or bad economically and efficiency-wise?  i'm sure you think the same thing. as long as people admit they're sinners, then that's a good start. next they should repent and receive christ for the forgiveness of their sins, like all christians should. no problem, big bear. you're cool. sounds like a good idea!
