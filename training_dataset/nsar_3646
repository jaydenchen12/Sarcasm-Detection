no benefits for laid-off religious workers - upi.com another example of religion getting special perks that they shouldn't have. and unfortunately, somebody else gets bit in the end. i find it difficult to believe that the religious organizations didn't realize they weren't paying unemployment tax. emoticonxrolleyes when they were busy not paying taxes, did they think that was a tax that they were somehow paying? it sounds like at least some religious organizations recognize the impact of their not paying taxes upon others, and take the responsible route to ensure that they as employers do right by their employees (e.g. catholic diocese of richmond). these people shouldn't have to needlessly suffer such an unexpected financial loss, but in the end it's the church that is to blame. they have been enjoying a benefit in not having to pay this tax, and now it's somebody else who suffers...
