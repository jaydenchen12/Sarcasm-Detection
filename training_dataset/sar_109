**Sounds more to me like a bunch of right-wing, no-neck, knuckle-dragging, drool-soaked, self-righteous slope-heads don't grasp the offensiveness of racist and chauvinist and other insults applied to groups of people, so long as they themselves do not belong to that group. If I haven't made you understand already, imagine a well-known media personality saying what I've just said to you, right out loud, to all the world, but off-the cuff and for no reason. Just to be 'witty' about right-wingers.Next time a black sport or other announcer casually describes a mostly caucasian bb team as a bunch of string-bean honkies on steroids, we'll see what happens. Oh, you say that's never happened yet!?! Gee, I guess you're right about that. I wonder why not?ww
