It was an incredibly progressive country under saddam. Women voted, drove, held jobs. Religous law was supressed and he ran a secular government. In addition, he did what no other leader int eh ME was willing, he shared the income fromthe oil fields. FRom a practical standpoint, no, he really wasn't that bad a guy. There was no "reign of terror".
