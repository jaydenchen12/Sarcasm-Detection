Bertvan: Perhaps Dr. Pigluicci doesn't see a difference between the organization of a hurricane and the organization of a living system. Most people do see a difference. The deterministic mechanisms that affect a hurricane are well understood and predictable. On the other hand no one can even speculate how such things as ‰ÛÏtemperature and embryonic diet‰Û might cause proteins to fold differently and thus ‰ÛÏwhip up‰Û complex systems such as ‰ÛÏeyes, bacterial flagella, wings and turtle shells‰Û
