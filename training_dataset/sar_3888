my challenge has been met? where? where?  did i assert that god did it? please find that quote. trebor is apparently atheistic, and seems to believe that god didnt do it. he offered no substantial argument that god didnt do it. the burden is on trebor (or whomever takes his position) to demonstrate that god didnt do it. i dont need to show that god did it; its trebors apparent position that god didnt do it that is in need of support. nobody has addressed #64. why is that? my challenge has been met? thats a big hoot. if somebody actually wants to argue, they should know what has already been argued, and be prepared answer the arguments presented. if you have no answer to #64, please just concede.
