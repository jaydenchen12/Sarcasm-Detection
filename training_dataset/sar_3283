sadly all the marketing around it is pointed on children whom simply aren't capable of deciding if they want to became addicted and die because of it or not. you obviously must have never seen a smoking commercial or public signs. you must not have a large brain either if you think that it doesnt affect the kids by even a smudge.  what they see is a 'cowboy' with revolver in one hand a cigarette in other.... and that is the primary source of smokers. oh really? where might i see this cowboy? might i have some evidence to support your appalling claims?
