howard dean says kill the bill. a great ed show interview with arianna huffington viewable at this huffpost link.  also an interesting exchange afterwards with joan walsh and brad blakeman. as ed says to joan -- the key question she never answers while disagreeing with dean -- is when did the republicans ever need 60 votes under george bush? it's a shame, grasshopper, you don't read or view anything from sources you fundamentally disagree with (including the declaration of independence, i gather), so therefore you cannot discuss it. after all, you might have 7 years of bad luck. emoticonxrolleyes
