i'm not saying you shouldn't argue against their weak moral position. i'm saying you shouldn't assume their emotions are what they would have to feel towards you to still oppose you if they shared your ethical system. of course they don't make one right. as for the kool-aid: i often see this referenced in arguments between americans, i have no idea what it is. i meant according to most christian theological viewpoints that oppose homosexual sex.
