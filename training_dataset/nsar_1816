I won't throw my ideas on abortion out there just yet, but I have to ask this question. Should fathers have to pay child support considering a mother could have mitigated the expense by having an abortion?For example: Jack is 55 and makes 20,000 a year. Jack gets injured by Bob, and can no longer work unless he gets a $1000 operation. Jack's religion or other views preclude getting the operation, so he sues Bob for $200,000, the wages he'll lose over the next ten years. Since Jack could mitigate his losses by having the operation, nost likely all he will be entitled to is $1000.So- shouldn't child support be limited to the cost of an abortion, under our current pro-abortion laws?
