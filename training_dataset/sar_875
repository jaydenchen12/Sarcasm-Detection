I agree with you.Do I want abortion to used for birth control? no...As you say, I agree things need to be looked at on a case by case bases; thats what choice is unless there are criteria. But again I agree, I can't set the criteria as well.You and I surely don't want the deaths back. Be it 10,000 or 80,000. Clearly we agree.Progress.
