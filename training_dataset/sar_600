Murder without pain is still murder. If you pour CO2 into a babies room while their sleeping they probably won't feel anything.Biologically the fetus is an individual human organism from conception, I don't think it's about consciousness or awareness because a newborn probably isn't aware of much, it's all really conjecture what they understand, and none of us remember. It's the principle, not whether the organism is sentient at that exact moment, but whether it as a category (species) is sentient.A sleeping person doesn't lose their rights because they can't pass the mirror test unconscious.
