Ah but interracial marriages were only socially prejudiced. There was no real biological basis for the prejudice. We know that interracial diversity is biologically sound. Sometimes there are genetic or congenital anomollies that can be detrimental to the offspring of interracial couples, but these conditions do not preclude the validity of said relationships. You are trying to equate sexuality with racial diversity. This is a false equation, for one, we do know racial traits are inherited and that races can interracially reproduce. This trumps homosexuality's abilities two fold.
