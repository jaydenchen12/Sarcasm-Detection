You said in one post you are a ex-christian. If you new anything of Christianity you would know this is not possible. It is possible you had the title of Christian without the relationship which gives you this title. Christianity subscribes to the power of God to save you, not of any power of your own. If one could be come unsaved, he becomes more powerful than God (Impossible within Christianity).
