Yeah, there are those who scream that self-defence is not a valid reason for gun ownership. There were no valid reasons until the libs thought them up, but I'll set that aside for now. The question here is wether or not you think hunting is a valid reason for gun ownership. I don't forsee any stats posted, as this thread has nothing to do with crime. So this is a chance for you to work on debating skills.
