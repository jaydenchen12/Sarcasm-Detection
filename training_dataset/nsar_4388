it should be legalised as it's no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco. not only that but many marijuana users end up going onto harder drugs through contact with their marijuana dealer. lesgalising it would break that link and actually reduce the level of drug addicts overall. furthermore you could tax it and put the money into more police to clamp down on hard drugs, which would be a good thing.
