i am speaking of the christian church. no offense to folks of other faiths. i am simply interested in what folks of any faith would say to this.  as a protestant, i would say the purpose of the church is to 'be jesus to the world'. individuals within the church are to use their god given gifts for the building up of the body to love one another and show the world what love is. any other thoughts, (or similar thoughts). remember we are looking at what ought not what is.
