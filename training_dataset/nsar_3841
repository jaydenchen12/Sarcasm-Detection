i was just wanting to make sure it was in the new testiment. my reason for this is you said... if the verse were from the old testiment, it wouldn't matter that jesus can come in and perfect one's heart because they didn't know who jesus was. that's really all. but it doesn't really matter since that's not really the main point of your post.
