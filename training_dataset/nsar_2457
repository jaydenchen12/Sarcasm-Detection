I agree... it's just too bad sometimes with young adults they don't think about what might happen, they just respond with natural urges. And this results sometimes is someone becoming " with child " even though it was not what they set out to do!So should we force them to have the child and put it up for adoption? If so consider there are lots of children waiting to be taken in and most of them aren't infants.
