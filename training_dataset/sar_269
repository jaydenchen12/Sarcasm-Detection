And if you think referring to me as Archie is some sort of insult or name to run away from, you couldn't be more wrong. I can't think of a past member of this forum whom I would like to be compared to more than him. Here, check out his profile, you wish you had this kind of following: 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: ArchangelHe's had more hits since being banned than you've had since being a member here. So keep calling me Archie/Archangel, you just keep him alive, you who will be labeled MONGO MAXIMUS THE 1st from this time forth.
