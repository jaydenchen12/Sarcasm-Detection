I called you a misogynist, dipemoticonXCensored. Read the dang post emoticonXBanghead . I said your misogyny and your bigotry run hand in hand with your brand of Christianity (your bigotry due to how you treat gays).It was in reply to this lovely statement from you: when I stated that I was a woman. Get a reading comprehension, AA. Do you know what misogyny means? Maybe that's your problem.As to me defending gays, I am friends with several, and basically feel disgusted at the way they are treated by people like you and the way they are denied the same rights of marriage that I just obtained with my husband.
