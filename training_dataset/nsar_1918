Creation: The belief that the universe (and of course everything in it) was created by some supernatural entity.To support creation you must first tackle the concept of something "outside" the knowable universe. Because this is irrational, the entire concept of creation is irrational to "believe" in. You can believe in it, but you must accept that the belief is not a rational belief.
