When placed on the ballot instead of being rammed down the public's throats by activist courts and out-of-touch legislators, gay marriage has a ZERO - 31 record. The fact is that the public, when it exercises its Constitutional Right to decide via the ballot box, has decided against gay marriage EVERY TIME.Gays can't blame the Christian Right and the Mormons for spending $Millions on this one. In fact, gays spent a ton on this one....and it didn't matter.
