i'd say a restraint fiscally would naturally cause better foreign relations. hard to make people happy when you attack other countries causing you to spend well into debt thus lowering your economy and bringing other economies with it. and another thing, if i hear just a few more 'i'm more like reagan than you are' then i might have to buy a new tv and explain to the police why my old one is blown to bits in the neighbors yard :)
