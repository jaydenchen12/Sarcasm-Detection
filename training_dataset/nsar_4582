i'm assuming static because that's the case i'm interested in. in real terms, i'm holding a ball; it's motionless with respect to the earth. i let go. what about warped space makes the ball move towards the earth? that's the specific question that i'm trying to get an answer to. yes, the marble should roll towards the ball regardless of the orientation of the sheet. if you use a horizontal sheet then the analogy works as long as you do it in the presence of gravity, but that smacks of a circular definition to me. an analogy for gravity that requires gravity doesn't convince me, or explain anything to me.
