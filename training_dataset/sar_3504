do you even follow the news?? seriously. there have been cases of msnbc being so offensive that even hillary clinton basically threatened to boycott them. geez. as far as huffington is concerned, the site you linked to itself is a good example, and is indicative of the same sort of junk liberals criticize conservative talking heads for. for instance, where were the photos that present tea party protestors in a positive light? why would they want to to take 10 photos (out of no doubt thousands that were perfectly peaceful) that present the worst possible elements they could find? that such doesn't raise a red flag to you speaks volumes.
