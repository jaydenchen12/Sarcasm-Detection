walking away... proves nothing... I cant prove he lived.. and you cant prove he didnt.I however could pull out this 2000 year old book, and the dead sea scrolls.. and say... well.. people have believed he did.. and wrote about it.And the level of detail is such that it would be difficult if not impossible for his existance to be a fable...except of course... we may all be living in a matrix computer program and all this stuff we see right now... maybe an illusion.. so..-Mosheh Thezion
