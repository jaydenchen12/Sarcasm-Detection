so what is it you are looking for?  sympathy? yes, i'm sorry you had to go through that. i wouldn't wish that on anyone. it sounds like you definitely had a difficult time and i can understand why you may have hesitated in a decision to let him live.  are you looking for mothers always having access to medical care which you almost did not have? i agree, they all should. though i don't think you would have been turned away at most any hospital--it probably happens on rare occassion. but i agree, women should have whatever medical care they need. if you are looking for me to say that 'abortion is ok in some circumstances', i can't do that unequivocally. if the life of the mother is in definite danger, then yes.
