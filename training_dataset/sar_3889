so what you're saying is that you will insist that there's no objective scientific evidence that supports the young earth account, but when it is presented for your consideration as requested, you will not only completely ignore it, but change the subject. so no comment on this evidence? http://www.halos.com/ after all, you made the absolute statement that there is no evidence for creationism at all! now back up your claim if you can, or at least refute my claim that there is evidence of the creation account. and you know what else pandion? those were some very sophisticated nomadic herdsmen to have written something that has not only survived humanities complete history, but has remained the most important book to more people than any other book that has ever been written. that's some pretty impressive nomads, dontya know!!! :)
