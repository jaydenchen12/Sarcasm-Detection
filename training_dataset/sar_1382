One of your old buddies told me your moniker in other forums, aaronsongs. And You're right, my mother didn't do a very good job raising me as a woman. Yours, on the other hand, did a great job, apparently. No strutting around like a rooster in your house, I bet. emoticonXRolleyesSaw your picture, too. Is that a tuft of hair or a horn growing out of the top of your head? LOL.....
