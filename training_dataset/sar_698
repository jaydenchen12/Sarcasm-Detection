behavior dictates risk. some practices are 'more risky' than others. but to say gays are more prone to hiv infection, suggest that heterosexuals are immune, or less prone...which is factually false. role models?? what are you talking about? you don't even know.  old camp fruits? you've lost the little mind that you had.  your daddy is more of an 'old camp fruit', than i ever could be, girlfriend.  and i'm in a monogamous marriage for the past 10 years. i need no announcements. you?
