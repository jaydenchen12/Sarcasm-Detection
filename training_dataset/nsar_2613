Please, PLEASE, don't talk about rationing health care. We already have the cruelest form of rationing in the world, that which is based on the ability to pay.In LA, if you're rich, you get Cedar-Sinai. If you're poor, you get the ER at LA General if you're lucky.Here in Denver, if you're rich, you get Rose Medical; if not, you get the ER at Denver Health Med. if you're lucky.What's YOUR suggestion to see that poor and working people get adequate health care?Oh, I forgot, you don't have one.
