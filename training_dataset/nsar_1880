He found that adaptive genetic mutations arising systematically under these circumstances outnumbered maladaptive and inconsequential mutations to a high degree, statistically speaking. A most significant finding, and one that has been repeated again and again and again, to the point where somatic hypermutation is accepted by bacteriologists as a legitimate 'immune response' enabling rapid adaptive [EAM] evolution [antibiotic resistance] in eusocial bacteria.
