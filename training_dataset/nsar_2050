Third, it is most tiresome to see all the horrors of the world ascribed to atheism when atheism has nothing to do with them. Atheism has nothing to do with the nationalism of the Nazis and Fascists, has nothing to do with the cult of personality established by various dictators and similar. And don't even try to claim I don't know any of it. I LIVE in the area you claim as "Tito's slaughterhouse". I KNOW what it was all about. And atheism didn't get even nearly close to the true causes.
