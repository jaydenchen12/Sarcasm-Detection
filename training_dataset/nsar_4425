but by that definition, either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom, including your view impeding on hers! we don't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals. it doesn't effect your religion or religious freedom if you don't get benefits under gay marriages. you can argue in other ways, on other basis, but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty 'argument'.
