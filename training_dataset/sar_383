You seem to think that child services only did this investigation this week. This was an investigation conducted in Feb, and the police and DA office would certainly have access to the report. The fact that they executed warrants and arrested wacko says that perhaps they have more to their case than this investigation. And also, keep in mind, that the "investigation" was done by private investigators hired by wacko, not by the police and DA's office.
