You have obviously been told this by a pro-choicer who will leap to any rationale no matter how shallow in order to justify his/her defense for abortion. He fails to appreciate that preventing an egg from being fertilized is not at all similar to murdering a fetus which is in many cases at a minimum of up to 3 months of development. Hi Ryuuichi, If I might defend your doctor for a second, I think I can explain his thinking. He/she understands that what you think you want at 17 yrs. old MIGHT be very different than what you will want when you are in your 20s and in love with your potential soul mate. At that time, when the man of your dreams is real and you two actually discuss your future lives together, if you then decide to get your tubes tied and never have children, he will be confident that your decision is rational and based on a mutual decision with your spouse. See the difference? To make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day. Very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children. In fact, I can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make. Think about it as a woman in love some day and you will see my point, I'm sure. emoticonXAngel
