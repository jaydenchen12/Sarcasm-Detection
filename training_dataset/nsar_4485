i think your question should be 'why did god make commandments?' because that's what 'thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet' are? and no, commandments are not designed to help you live happily and without fear. its actually the exact opposite: commandments serve the purpose of keeping people under control through the use of fear.  sin means diobeying the commandments. as for homosexuality and witchcraft, they are sins because there are commandments against them.
