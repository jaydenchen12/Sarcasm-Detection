yet it is a conculsion derived without evidence. it is only based on what is seen in an instant, not what is seen through time. you just proved my point that there is a preconcieved notion. it has been taught to you. (at least, i seriously doubt you have gone out and observed something evolving first-hand). constant mutation in every generation is not something observed. it still would not account for the extreme specificity of nylon. again, the chances of- a random mutation allowing multiple (i assume there was more than 1 survivor) organisms to digest a synthetic material that happens to be dumped where they are- are very much against it
