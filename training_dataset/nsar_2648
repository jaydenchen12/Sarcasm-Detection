You liked to David Icke - the guy who beleives that Giant Lizards are secretly running the world today...you need to take this with a pinch of salt.Anyway, I honestly don't really see a problem with salvaging things from the dead that are going to benefit the rest of mankind. It sounds icky, and is to a degree but seems better than feeding them to maggots or just burning them.Fair enough if you want have it as an option like Organ Donors but seems the same thing really to me, especially as there are babies that die because they need immediate organ or tissue donors after being born.Its the allegations of babies being killed to fund this I doubt, seems to be an attempt to sensationalise a piece of news. I stand by the original point that there isn't really a medical use for fetus skin as was claimed, some of the organs might be of more use but thats about it.
