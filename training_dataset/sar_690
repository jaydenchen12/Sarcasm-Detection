Anti-choicers don't give two whits about life, or really believe in the absolute value of a fetus. This story is a good example of that. I bet a lot of so-called "pro-lifers" would support this court's decision, even though the mother posed no real threat, and she could have miscarried the fetus:For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all.
