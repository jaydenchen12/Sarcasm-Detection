what's the point in inviting a bunch of famous people? i say this as a huge fan of deniro's and scorsese's: a dinner party would be not be as intellectually stimulating than if you had, say, descartes and kierkegaard in their place. sure, they've probably a hell of a lot of stories and anecdotes which would prove entertaining, but they're ... they're filmmakers, of all things!
