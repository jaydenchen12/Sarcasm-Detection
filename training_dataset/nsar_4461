most schools also have rules regarding the age of those who can attend prom, ie. no freshman or dates over 20, should we end that discrimination as well? what right was she standing up for exactly? the right to violate dress code? right to ignore the prom rules?  obviously the rest of the prom going students didn't want her making their prom into a political statment, what about their wishes?
