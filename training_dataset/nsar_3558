yeah, i agree with everyone else who has seen the new batmans. they both literally blew my mind. that is what a comic book adaption is supposed to be, not that silly bs from the old movies. here's the order. 1. new batman movies 2. x-men 3. ironman 4. the first spiderman movie only!!!! 5. superman and honestly, i debate whether to even include superman. below the 5th listed all the superhero movies are dead to me. screw them. and after the first spiderman movie they turned into cheesy suck fests. i watched that scene with the stupid cart on that wire. ugh, i swore to never watch another spiderman movie again, didn't even see the end. absolutely terrible.
