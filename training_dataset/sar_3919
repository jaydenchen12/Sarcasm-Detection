define for me precisely how gravity effects light as it travels through space. or how it effects gamma rays as it passes near planets, stars or as it passes through one universe into another one. is their an extra pressure zone where two galaxies or universes meet that is caused by their unique gravitational forces? and if so, what effect does it have on the light or gasses that pass between them genius?
