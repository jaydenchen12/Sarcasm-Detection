Incidentally, is the title of this forum meant to imply that creationism and Intelligent Design are two names for the same thing? While I agree that they are more similar to each other than to evolution, it troubles me that anyone would believe that they are synonymous. For those that think the title is justified, what about the two beliefs do you find similar enough to class them as the same idea?
