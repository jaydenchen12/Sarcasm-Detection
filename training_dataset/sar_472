how boring. i hope they do bomb the us, but actually get the pentagon this time. of course, dumb patriots will let the gov't do anything then. i remember when the show 'talking to americans' asked random americans whether they should bomb saskatchewan. without asking for any more information, people gave long explanations about how saskatchewan needed to be put under control and all kinds of bs.  of course, saskatchewan is a canadian province which is not at all being considered a threat by the us gov't. that doesn't matter. the us political climate is such right now that people will swallow any amount of bs, and are willing to excuse any action on the part of their gov't. pathetic.
