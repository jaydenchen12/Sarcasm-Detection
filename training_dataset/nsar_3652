so every republican president for the last 30 years has been a rino...and every republican congressman?  the fact is that government has expanded faster under republican administrations than democratic ones for almost 50 years now, easy.  this shows that, like so many other things, you are completely ignorant of ron pauls position on iran. he does not advocating 'appeasing' iran. see, like out founding fathers, paul believes that if they dont threaten our national security, it has nothing to do with us and we should leave them alone. that costs us nothing. running around the world fighting pre-emptive wars that bankrupt us against opponents who posed no danger to us is not a viable long term strategy.
