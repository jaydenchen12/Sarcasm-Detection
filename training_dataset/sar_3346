not that i have the time to research this (it's fairly obvious anyway) the blue states tend to send the sleaziest bastards to washington. that's a fact. you can count the red scum and the blue scum. you'll find the blue scum returned to washington by their constituency while the red scum is continually kicked out of office. i'd rather be a dead republican than a democrat.
