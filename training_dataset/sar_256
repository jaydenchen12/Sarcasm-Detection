keep it up zardoz, you only condemn yourself with your anti-christian zealotry and hypocrisy. you claim to properly interpret a bible you admit you don't even accept as truth. the hubris you exhibit would be laughable if it wasn't so pathetic. dr has more humble truth in his little finger nail than you have accumulated in your whole spiritually destitute life. if you would sincerely seek a truth greater than yourself, you might actually be set free to find it. and i sincerely do say this out of love. emoticonxangel
