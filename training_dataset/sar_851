Simone, you are one sick puppy. We are a safety conscious group! Once you fix the evil within the heart of man, we will then consider your point of view on the 2nd Amendment. However, if you were ever successful, then there would be no need to for your view of the 2nd Amendment. Let me speak everyone here. We wish not only Amanda Ross was not only living and safe, but perhaps had the weapon to protect herself from her assailant, if she was comfortable doing so! Hey I just had another group you could blame. Blame law enforcement because they can't be everywhere all of the time!
