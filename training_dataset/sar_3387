well, i guess the point is...if one is right, you have to have a basis for determining which to follow instead of going at a whim. if you choose to honor some stuff of the bible and not some other stuff in it than you pretty much ruled out that religion, have you not? if you haven't than what basis to you have for changing the rules? the preists surely aren't 'god in disguise' now are they?
