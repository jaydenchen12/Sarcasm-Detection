i am offering any of you creationists, christians, etc, the chance to prove me wrong. of course, to have this chance, you must also accept that i have full ability to argue with you. i used to be a christian, but after extensive studying and questioning, threw it away. do not talk to me unless you have a somewhat open mind to argue things. my aim is pikeman852003 my icq is 117686925 my msn is pikeman85@hotmail.com if you want to argue with me, add me. i'll argue with anyone who wants to, but be advised, when i argue with people, i often make them question things they had never thought of. i have convinced several people to severly question or even give up their faith using reasoning and facts. argue with me at your own risk. i originally posted this on the old forums, then learned they were obsolete.
