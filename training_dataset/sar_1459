You know, I think that you are rather an evil person, trying to create guilt where no guilt exists, where no guilt is necessary. Someone made a very important decision at a critical point in her life which made her life better and averted the consequences of a stupid mistake made by a youth. It was not an easy decision for her to make but she made it and it's well in the past, except for the people who want her to feel guilt and trauma about it.
