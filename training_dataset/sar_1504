What I would like to see is a rather antiquated method of community. Have all the destroyed housing areas razed and bulldozed to level, bare soil, then have massive 'barn-raising' house building, where the people (in that area) pitch in to rebuild each others houses (and build theirs). It's somewhat like Habitat for Humanity too, with the difference being all neighbors pitch in.
