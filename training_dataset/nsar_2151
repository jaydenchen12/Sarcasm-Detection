I don't think the point was to come up with an exact number of gun laws. The point was to show that the 20,000 figure often claimed by the pro-gun side is very doubtful. But the total number of gun laws may not tell us a whole lot. 100 cities could pass laws to require waiting periods. That would count as 100 gun laws. Or the Federal Government could pass one law to require a waiting period throughout the nation. It would count as one law but would have more of an effect than 100 separate city laws.
