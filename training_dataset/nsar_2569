Apparently, you have five questions.If by 'ability for inward perspective' you imply the ability to look at one's self, it is incongruent to say you are leary of our ability 'to think of life from a gay perspective'. What you are asking is for people to see your troubles from your perspective...hardly possible for many.Yes. Were I a logical gay man, I would accept the fact that I cannot marry a man due to the definition of marriage. I would accept that fact and continue to demand that all legally joined couples share the same benefits now given to married couples.
