at least with sport the best players are fairly easily identified, everyone can watch them in action and judge for themselves. with corporate officers it is much more ambiguous. there is no indication that firms are actually competing for the top talent, they just seem to be cycling around the same faces and awarding themselves ever larger pay rises.
