What is the problem here? Guns or crooks stealing guns? They steal from all of society including LEOs,the military etc. not unlike the situation in Mexico. Proof is in that most of those thefts were from government sources. It is correct there is no authority granted Con-gress in Article 1, section 8 to legislate rights restrictions and recently in Heller that was reinforced.When are you leaving? :) Watch the doorknobs on the way out and all that stuff.
