can we stick to the issues ink? stupid personal attacks waste time and distract from what's really important. now then, to rebut your smears... 'while wright is a controversial pastor and a fiery advocate for blacks and liberal causes and a fierce critic of anti-black discrimination, we've seen no evidence that he preaches hatred of or discrimination against whites.' http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/                                      sliming_obama.html  'the mccain campaign is distorting the obama-ayers relationship, and exaggerating their closeness. there is no evidence that obama has 'lied' about his dealings with ayers.' http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/10/did_obama_lie_about_ayers.html  as for acorn... yeah, these guys look like real sons of bitches... everyone knows trying to help the poor makes you a radical commie.
