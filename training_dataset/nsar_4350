you can stop with the word games, you know very well what i'm talking about. but i will clarify.. congress has the power to declare war...  but congress cannot make war..  you are implying that congress can go into session and just vote for a declaration of war without the president being involved. it may give them this power under the constitution but the constitution is vague at best and in the absence of a clear directive they normally follow the precedent that was set by the first declaration of war... and since every single time we have issued a declaration of war the president of the u.s. initiated it that is the precedent we follow. and let me add.. the president can veto a declaration of war as well.
