You're taking that stance again? Arrest people for whatever excuse is convenient and simply let the courts sort out the details at a later date, requiring the accused to pay large sums of money to prove their own innocence?Hardly a civilized approach to the law. Assuming people are guilty and treating them as such, until such time that they can prove that they're actually innocent, just isn't the way to do things.
