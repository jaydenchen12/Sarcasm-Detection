I think the crazy came first and the zealootry is just a symptom. I see OCD and mania is zealotry. Obssessiveness is not healthy - regardless of what your obsessing over. Also, one needs to be careful about the lable. For example, nt everyone who opposes gay marriage for religious reasons is a zealout. I would say most are not. Take Easy and JP. Both have religious reasons for opposing gay marriage (that should not be the problem of anyone outside their faith, but I digress...), however I would only call Easy a zealot. JP may be an occasionally obnoxious conservative apologist who can even teeter on redneck from imie to time, but he is no zealout.
