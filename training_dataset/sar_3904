which is exactly why i asked  why are these opinions shallow and vaccuous? and just to push your opinion a little further, if the soul enters the new being at fertilization, then does this mean that those girls (though very rare) who are born just from an unfertilized egg have no souls. is a special case made for these human beings? one might ask the same question of the even more rare boy born of a virgin mother. i'm not saying that you are wrong. i was just wondering if your theory extends this far. smiley
