you do realize it was the catholic church which adopted the idea of pagan marriage and then changed its definition to suit its needs?  not to mention that it was the catholic church who again changed the definition of marriage from man and property to man and wife?  either you're lying or you are just flaming ignorant. besides your rational is based upon your own inherent irrational thoughts and tradition. that sort of reasoning as a basis for legislation ends up with governments like iran.
