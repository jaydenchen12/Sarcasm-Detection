i said a few posts up that i don't think that people are actually offended. it's strictly a seperation of church and state issue. incorrect. check out my post above from 7-19 to see the legal issues. in particular, the government may not take any action whos primary effect is to advance or endorse religion and 'the constitution forbids not only state practices that 'aid one religion...or prefer one religion over another,' but also those practices that 'aid all religions' and thus endorse or prefer religion over nonreligion'.
