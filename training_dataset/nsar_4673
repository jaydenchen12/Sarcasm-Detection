mastershake, i could never argue against a religion that is based on faith. an argument or debate is based on reason and logic and faith-based religions are not reasonable or logical. are we agreed now that faith cannot differentiate between *truth and falsity*? *edited  cthulhu, unfortunately we couldn't even prove one of them wrong because they are faith based.
