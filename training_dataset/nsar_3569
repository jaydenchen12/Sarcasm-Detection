i can't tell if you're agreeing or disagreeing with david.  david comes out against intervention in the market, and says crony capitalists want more intervention in the market. obama wants to hand out money to politically connected auto industry players. are you saying david is right, and we need less government intervention in the market, or that he is wrong, and we need the government to give more money to corporations? a 'faux argument' would be a pretend argument, like pretending you are an ardent pro-lifer, and making up terrible arguments, to make the pro-life position look ridiculous. kind of like a strawman except in character.
