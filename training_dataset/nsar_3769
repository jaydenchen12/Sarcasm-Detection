is that with the coach who threw a temper tantrum and yelled at the ump and then after getting called out of the game, threw bats out onto the field? if so, i first saw that on jay leno last night. all the time, i thought it was some jay leno video joke. it was funnier when it turned out not to be a joke at all.
