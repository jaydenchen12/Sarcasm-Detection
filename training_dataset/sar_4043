sorry to burst your bubble, but non-gene inheritance is non-materiastic inheritance, which absolutely does contradict toe. (how exactly does it happen that thought or awareness generates a new physical trait and then pass it down?) and never has it been proven that any spontaneous, randomly-occurring mutation has ever created a beneficial, selectable morphological novelty, so ultimately, it's your materialist theory that has no evidence. i have evidence, you don't.
