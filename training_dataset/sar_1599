That's an interesting insight.(I'm going to have to borrow that story... :p I can't help but wonder for some people if the reason they "mature" on the issue of heterosexual sex has to do more with the fact that they start wanting to do it themselves.A desire to partake in the action, as opposed to actual mature development, causes them to shift their attitudes towards heterosexuality.To me, that's one of the reasons Christianity (in general) has such a "tolerance" for divorce, which Jesus spoke out against explicitly, while not as much tolerance for homosexuality.They want to do the divorce thing or sympathize with the desire for it, so suddenly it's more "tolerated"... emoticonXRolleyes
