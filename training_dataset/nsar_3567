it's marketing 101. in order to sell something, you have to convince people that they need it. in order to sell religion they convince people that they need it by telling them they are going to hell if they don't buy into their religion. the more things you declare a sin, the more people will be 'guilty' of those things, thereby increasing your customer base.
