no. it would show that the government actually opposed the hostage takers.  over the last generation or so, the dutch became quite good at rescuing hostages from the hijacked trains that became an annual event; the russians lost a number of hostages in a theater a few years ago when the gas they used proved a bit strong; and the filipinos became notorious for losing all hostages. but in every case where hostages were lost, the government was criticized for lack of competence rather than complicity. in iran, the mullahs were tacitly complicit in the crime. surrender to terrorism, such as you propose, does not work in the real world - it only encourages the terrorists.
