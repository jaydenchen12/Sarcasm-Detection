Keep in mind two important points:1. Reason does not imply truth, it's a method of seperating truth from what is false, and you can quite easily (and do every day), reason something to a false conclusion. 2. You can believe whatever you like, and it can certainly impact your life (faith), however it cannot be said that faith is based on rational belief, or takes part in reason, in any way, it is the opposite of reason.
