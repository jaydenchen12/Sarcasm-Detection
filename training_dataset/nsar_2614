[i][indent]"Canada has "hate" speech/crimes laws and regulations and Canadian Christians, along with other people of faith, are being vehemently persecuted for speaking out publicly against the acceptance and promotion of homosexuality within their own country. I was told by Rev. Tristan NOT to bring most of our resources on homosexuality, for going through the Canadian border, they might get seized and I could possibly be denied entry into Canada. I was able to bring several hundred of SBM's tracts for the attendees, "I Was Gay" and "The Traditional American Family."
