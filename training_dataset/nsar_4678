You do have a good point. However, it does not change my mind. We do our best to make cars as safe as we can, but so many people need to travel fast just to work and survive. More importantly, when one gets into a car, they know that they run the risk of crashing.  I do my best to make my house as safe as I can. Firearm possession is one of the means to attain that safety. When the criminal breaks into a home that criminal knows that he runs a risk of earning a chalk outline. Remove the firearms and remove the risk to the criminal. Consequently, ye increase the risk to the homeowner.
