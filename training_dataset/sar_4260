but what is apparent externally is not what is important. what is important is, if i teleported you, would you still experience the world through that new body.  if the answer is yes, the question is begged of just how identical does the new you have to be to the old one in order for you to experience the world in it. there is no reason to think that if we left a finger off of the new you, it wouldn't be you, because if i cut off your finger right now you would still be trebor. we get to the point where we could make you a completely different person, but still allow that this new body is yours. in addition, if two of you were created, you experience the world through two bodies, which also is not possible.
