Science tells us that there was no global flood a la Noah, not that there is no God.Now, if you choose to interpret that as a reasonable person and realize that science shows that "a Noah's flood-causing God" does not exist, then kudos. This does not mean that there is no God whatsoever.The error you are making is that you are equating creationism with God. We've disproved special creation. Handily. So one might say that there's good evidence that a God represented by a literal interpretation of the Bible does not exist. But that doesn't mean that no God exists, or that a Christian God doesn't exist.
