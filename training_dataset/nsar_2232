What are you talking about ample time? I starting following this tread last afternoon? What is your point?1) Did the NRA and KKK ever burn a cross together?2) Does Lockheed Martin in Colorado build nukes, missiles, and bombs?3) Did Chuck Heston ever say "From my cold dead hands in Denver"?4) How many edits does it take to make a point? If it is a documentry then why minipulate a speech?1) That is a cartoon? Do you believe in cartoons? My nephew believes that things he sees in Bugs Bunny is real. Do you? Moore manufactured a monster from the NRA.You were manipulated.
