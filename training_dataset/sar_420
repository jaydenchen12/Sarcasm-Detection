People make definitions. They then make statements that make sense according to those defintions. You interept their statements terms of your own defintions. Maybe your definition are in a sense better but many people adopt the position that when someone defines things you interept them using their defintions AND THEIR DEFINTIONS ALONE. You do not seem to think this should be done. This is the main reason why people treat you the way they do. It actually has little to do with them practicing objectivism or scientism.
