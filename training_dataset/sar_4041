and you are the one now discriminating!! against the ones who cannot affor to send their children to private or parochial schools (which is why i support vouchers). you're really pulverizing the dead horse here chettie!!! when even liberals are supporting educational alternatives to the cesspools called the public skrewel (thank you elrushbo) system, that must mean something. throwing more money into and forcing children into the cesspools like that will not solve the poor performace of the education establishment, that's been done for decades with lousy results. in fact, buffalo schools superintendant, dr. james williams; is endeavoring to bring the district schools up to the same performance standards as the charters.
