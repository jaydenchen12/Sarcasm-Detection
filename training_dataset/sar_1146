In the quote which you referenced, the bottom line was "The point at which we assign rights IS a matter of opinion." That is part of what we are debating in the abortion debate.However, unlike the term person or the ideas about when rights begin, the term genocide is NOT a matter of opinion and it DOES have a very specific DEFINITIVE meaning, as defined in the definitions posted over the last few pages. I say that your claim of abortion being genocide is untrue and unsupported by logical arguement. It does not match that definition. You are the one who are spouting the importance of being definitive, yet the only support that you have given is gross distortions of the actual definition.
