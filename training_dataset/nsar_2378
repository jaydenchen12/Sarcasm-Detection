Evolutionists have taught for decades that the second law of thermodynamics‰ÛÓthe entropy principle that things naturally decrease in complexity rather than increase‰ÛÓposes no barrier to evolution. Their claim is that while there is an overall downhill trend in nature, uphill innovations can occur locally in a system if abundant energy is available. Specifically the sun's energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people. All that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy, especially the sun's energy. If complicated living organisms can be created in this way, certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced. Especially a solar-powered house!
