No more funding of these stupid wars off the books.Start paying for them up front just like we're supposed to do for health care for Americans.A surtax on the rich who are benefiting from profiteering on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.No surtax? No surge.An evilly unfair burden has been put on American's soldiers and their families, the soldiers who have been deployed and redeployed and redeployed and redeployed over and over again while Dick Cheney makes money off both wars.It stinks to Holy Hell!
