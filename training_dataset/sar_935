I'm not in the least surprised.. I stated that it was required by Law.. I never said anything about when it became a requirement. As of now, in the year 2010 applying for a SS number is required.. Would you say that is an invasion of Privacy?.. and for your Information Clinton wasn't the first or last President to Rape the Social Security program.. Politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades.
