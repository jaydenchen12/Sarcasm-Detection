this is the question her campaign and the whole democratic party need to answer. clinton has almost no chance of winning the nomination without causing a rift in the party, and she has an even smaller chance of winning in the general.  recent polls say that almost half of all americans have a negative opinion of her, and the reverend wright scandal seems to have hurt obama less than clinton's campaign has hurt her in the past weeks. the longer hillary clinton stays in the race, the less likely it is that the democrats will win in november.
