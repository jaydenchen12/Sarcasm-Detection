some people just need killin'. really, it's as simple as that. life in prison? hah, what's to stop them from killing other inmates? maybe some poor bastard who stole some cash from a 7/11 to get food for his family got thrown in the slammer and suddenly he's got leatherface up his ass with a chiv? i dunno, maybe i care about the general population but murderers need to die. plain and simple.
