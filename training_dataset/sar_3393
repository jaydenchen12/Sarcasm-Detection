it is kind of funny how abortion has to do with a woman's body. and yet, if it was left up to the state: congress: women hold 81, or 15.1%, of the 535 seats in the 109th us congress  14, or 14.0%, of the 100 seats in the senate and 67, or 15.4%, of the 435 seats in the house of representatives. in addition, three women serve as delegates to the house from guam, the virgin islands and washington, dc. only 15.1%... so that means that 276 men (51 senate/ 225 congress) will be needed just to pass a law that has to do with a women's body...and if its something that could be bad for a woman and/or unfairly good for a man then they can get no where near the amount of senators/representatives needed to supress it.... [66.6666-15.1 = 51.56666--(535/100)(51.56666)=276]  (http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/of...rs/cawpfs.html)
