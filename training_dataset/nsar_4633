whether the anglican church is apostolic or not is a matter of opinion. the roman church started as an imperial church. its claim to apostolic succession is dubious as well, given the nature of some of the pope's in the middle ages, who were clearly chosen by outside influences. the independence of the church of england may have started with henry, but anglicanism is more correctly dated from elizabeth. the priest was and is well aware that i am an anglican, though we are of the same faith, christianity. so was his predecessor who i also received communion from. deviation from catholic dogma is common in the catholic church.
