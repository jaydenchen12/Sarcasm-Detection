look, i lost my response; i'm not going to retype it because in hindsight i was just repeating the same thing: you and i both know the issue is the morality of the act, choice is meaningless because all the law is, is the use of force to prevent (or prevent further) immoral choices. me condemning something as immoral is the same as advocating it be outlawed which is the exact same 'making a decision' as telling someone that just because they can kill others doesn't mean it's their choice. the high dollar question is whether the fetus is human, biologically it is; not at the time all that a human can be but none of us ever achieve that. you said you are concentrating on 9 months, i don't see a difference you can abort child rearing just as easily after birth by killing the child or abandoning it.
