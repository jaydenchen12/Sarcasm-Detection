there was a catagory 5 hurricane back about 105 years ago that hit texas. as long as catagory 5 hurricans have been happening, it doesn't make sence that catagory 5s are created by a cold war device. now the fact that there is a hurricane in the pacific ocean (it's named a boys name that starts with the letter 'm'. hurricanes are not supposed to happen in the pacific ocean. the fact that a hurricane is in the pacific ocean when usually in the pacific ocean is a typhoon (and a cyclone over austrailia) suggest something odd. emoticonxwow
