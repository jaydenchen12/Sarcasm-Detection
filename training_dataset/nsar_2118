Actually, the title is a little deceptive, however I have noticed that one verse in his new song "Runaway Love", one of the verses brings up something relevant on the abortion debate. Verse 3 goes of the song, I noticed goes:"Little Erica is eleven years oldShe's steady trying to figure why the world is so coldSo she pops x to get rid of all the pain'Cause she's having sex with a boy who's sixteenEmotions run deep and she thinks she's in loveSo there's no protection he's using no gloveNever thinking 'bout the consequences of her actionsLiving for today and not tomorrow's satisfactionThe days go by and her belly gets bigThe father bails out he ain't ready for a kidKnowing her mama will XXXX it all outta proportionPlus she lives poor so no money for abortionErica is stuck up in the world on her ownForced to think that hell is a place called homeNothing else to do but get her clothes and packShe say she's about to run away and never come back."I know its not completely relevant to the abortion issue, but it is very relevant to the lives of little girls living in poverty and being abused. I would like to know what your opinion of the verse is.
