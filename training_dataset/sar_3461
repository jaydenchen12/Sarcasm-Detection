your not commenting. your trying to convince people, you and your point of view is right. your trying to convince people here in the usa to follow your ideas.  is your father an aussie citizen? if he is, then he is no longer a us citizen. no need to answer, just a thought. i am sure your are not a us citizen. so your argument to convince people really does not matter does it? your attempts to convince people you are right and influence our policies sickens me. please take you imperialistic attitudes somewhere else.
