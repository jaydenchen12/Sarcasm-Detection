I don't expect you to believe anything outside of your limited range of understanding. But now I'll expect the scoffing and mocking to start, but no evidence to substantiate your ridiculous claims of soft tissue lasting 60 million years when I have just provided good evidence that it is very reasonable to believe that the soft tissue from the T-Rex isn't more than a few thousand years old at best. That dinos and in fact dragons are contemporaries of humans, not distant evolutionary descendents.
