You accuse "liberals" of spin?The first site that listed NK as being a state sponsor of terrorism was given to you in post #31 right after you asked for specific evidence to counter each point, AND AGAIN IN POSTS #37 AND #42, in which I actually copied and pasted the entire article.Further to that, is it my fault you were incapable of finding the info posted in the "second horses mouth" link when it was right under your nose in the first State Dept. link?Obviously, we're seeing what kind of a man you really are BITM. emoticonXRolleyes Waxy
