indeed. it relies on an all powerful unrestrained government to run the businesses, (otherwise privet persons get rich can't have that) and distribute wealth amongst the population. but at the same time requires that same government to be genuinely benevolent which doesn't happen 9 times out of 10 when you give a person or group of people that kind of power they will abuse it. not to mention that stalin alone killed more of his own people that hitler killed jews. not to mention all the other communist leaders that also committed genocides. mao, pol pot, castro, chaves, etc. the nazis are guilty of attempted genocide compared to those guys.
