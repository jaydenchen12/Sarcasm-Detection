One other point: Say that the laws of physics (which are derived from mutual human experience) are wrong but just appear to be right and that some omnipotent being can change them whenever he likes. If these apparent laws have remained the same for all of recorded human time, then why should we suspect that they may change at any moment? It all comes down to probability - if things are not what we expect they are from Science, then that should have manifested itself by now.
