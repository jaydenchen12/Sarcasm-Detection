The dino would be to heavy to glide or fly with them if they weren't fully developed, and even then only a few yards could be gained when jumping off a hill, ect, and when not fully ready. the would hinder the dino by hunting, by giving it a larger profile, and something else to get wounded for no benefits in return.
