i watched a program on einstein and his theory of relativity yesterday on the history channel. good stuff. i'm a little interested in what he was working on when he croaked - the unification theory. that will develop more in time and then i'll pay more attention to it. i think god is the great physicist, and we'll see the beauty of his laws of physics in due time. 'for the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. he has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.' (nasa astronomer robert jastrow, god and the astronomers, p. 116.)
