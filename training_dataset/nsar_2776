I don't believe in any gods, but thankyou for assuming anyone who disagrees with your ridiculous assertions about proving gods non-existance must be a theist.Just like creationists assume anyone who disagrees with creationism must be an atheist.You're just as bad as them, and your arguments, if you could call them that, just as short on substance.
