I read an article yesterday (about Evolution, Extinction, and Economics) in which it was claimed that 99% of all species that have ever existed are now extinct.This sort of claim (which I've come across before) troubles me: how can it be asserted, with any certainty at all:1). The number of species which have evolved.2). The percentage of that number that have become extinct.????
