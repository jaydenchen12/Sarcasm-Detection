that is a poor argument. if you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using 'what i've been told' as an argument. your opposition will tear you apart. :)  think about a specific statement that you think you can prove through a series of logical arguments regardless of your personal feelings on the subject and invite me to a private debate on it. i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. if you agree, of course.
