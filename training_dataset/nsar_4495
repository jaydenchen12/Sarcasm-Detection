no doubt that people who are determined to be anti-bush will always try and find something wrong with it, but i think bush's speech last night was very good. he was confident, poised, the speech had substance and specifics, and he showed once again that he's a better orator than he's given credit for. even a number of democrats complemeted it. only the hardest people would not be touched by the iraqi woman who's husband was killed by saddam's intel, embracing the mother of a fallen soldier. a lot of people got teary at that unstaged moment, including the president himself. kind of put the whole thing in perspective.
