I don't now, nor have I ever run away from debates here or anywhere else. The fact is that none of you have an original thought between you so I'm not here to banter back and forth anymore, but to give my opinions and move on to another subject. The reality is that opinions are all we have here so arguing minutia back and forth is a waste of time and bandwidth. I really don't feel the need to respond to the names you mooks end up calling me since I know my place in eternity, so have at it for all I care. It makes no difference to me at all. emoticonXAgree
