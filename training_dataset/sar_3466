its a download link for a pdf file provided by nasa about guadalupe (which i gave you before). but heres an article that might amuse you.you may do more research if you wish though i love how you cling to hope that your god exists. you actually believe that god has no time to help all of the starving people, but does have the time to create guadalupe's eyes. i am really glad that your great being is doing lots with his power.
