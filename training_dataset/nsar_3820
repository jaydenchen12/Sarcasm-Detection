i'm only rabidly against something so obviously untrue as that of mainstream religion. my argument is that the only reason it is mainstream is that we continually perpetuate it by indoctrinating our kids with it. do you honestly believe you would have found whatever religion you prescribe to if you had not been persuaded to from an early age? why didn't you pick islam? the only difference in christianity and islam in my mind is that islam happens to be the religion of poor states that have been oppressed by empire states. if christianity was the religion in the middle east and northern africa and the west was islamic, you would probably see suicide bombing christians. i expect i will likely get another roflmao out of you for saying this, but it is probably true.  the only difference between islam and christianity is demographic.
