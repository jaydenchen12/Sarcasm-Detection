Because they couldn't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois, limiting people to mainly deer rifles.Whatever you read is irrelevant. In Heller the judges ruled it was illegal and unconstitutional to ban ownership of an entire class of firearms, such as handguns. In McDonald they extended that same standard to all 50 states. Gun control makes crime worse. Look at how many murders Chicago admitted they experienced each year that involved handguns. Nearly all of them.
