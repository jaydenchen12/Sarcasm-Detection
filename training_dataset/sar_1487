Well sure, he wouldn't. But I doubt he'd approach torture from the standpont of anything constitutes it, either. And if someone were concerned about what constituted torture, I doubt he'd pretend it wasn't a valid question, as you're doing.How do you know exactly what Jesus would approve and condemn??? Do you now do what fundies do and claim to speak for him? Jesus said some pretty rough stuff at times. He talked about people being thrown into darkess with weeping and gnashing of teeth, and being cast into hell fire.
