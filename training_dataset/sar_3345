i am leaving the job to those more qualified. i'm weighing the yes-votes against the no-votes, and the yes-votes are strongly winning. this is what the word consensus means. qualified global warming skeptics still seem to me to be a small minority. 650 are mentioned in this report. but when i think of all the climate scientists in the world, there must be tens or hundreds of thousands on the other side of the debate.
