i found this by chance and really couldn't resist replying: 'these are people captured on the battlefield.' please define whjat is measnt by battlefield exactly, my understanding is that battlefield = anywhere on earth 'many of the ones released have been either recaptured or shot in combat' sorry i don't beleive your corporate controlled bullshit media. 'because they're terrorists!' all i have to say to this revolting excercise in hypocrisy is the following: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4pgpbqfxgo  'this is war people, you have to start entering the reality of the situation.' really, oh well when you put it that way, actually just out of curiosity who are you fighting against, oh yeah, a tactic called terrorism which you use more than any other nation on earth. your true colours are on display for all to see, good day:0
