It is no shock that if you have a religious moral code that rejects a lifestyle then you would then reject that lifestyle. What is shocking is that one would take the idea of rejecting a lifestyle and declaring it "homophobia" or "gay-bashing". It is a great example of taking a fact and drawing unreasonable conclusions from that. But no one would make such a crazy claim on these forums emoticonXRolleyes
