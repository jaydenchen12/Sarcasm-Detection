I got the number from the Documental Centre for Human Rights in Iraq, although I did some research on them and they are affiliated with the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, so they're not exactly Saddam friendly.Human Rights Watch puts the number at 290.000 deaths.The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.
