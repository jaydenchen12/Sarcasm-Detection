mercy and killing should never be put together.there is no such thing as having so much compassion that justifies you putting a toddler to death. Dont people realize that children are gifts and not something that should be taken so lightly as to steep so low in stopping a beating heart all for the sake of selfishness and convenience for one's self.. There is absolutely no thought whatsoever in the baby, its all about "how can i live easier without this problem?".there is no such thing as compassionate killing. What it really means is "killing in the name of mercy for my comfort".people need to start realizing that the world doesnt revolve around them and that life itself is a gift TO ALL! EVEN THOSE LITTLE ONES THAT PEOPLE RIGHT NOW THINK DONT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO LIVE. look in the mirror!
