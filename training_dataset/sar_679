What I marvel at is that you're not even embarrassed to ask such an ignorant question. Because if it's a chicken egg, and if it's allowed to incubate to term, it sure isn't going to be a crow when it hatches. And to be even more simplistic, a chicken egg is still a chicken while it's in the egg. Just as a human being is still a human being in the womb.
