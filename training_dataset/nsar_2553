Ok according to the bible God only created the first two beings, Adam and Eve. Now christians dont rule out science, and science has shown that we produce offspring. God has created these offspring but not directly. Think of photosynthesis, we eat meat, this is getting energy from the sun indirectly. So we have shown that we ourselves produce offspring but we are put here and given the abbility by God to produce offspring. As far as your question on why God alows addicts to have babies it can be explained as this. We where given the freedome of choice to decide if we want to be an addict, wrong put we have the choice. God created us to have that choice, or else we would be robots. The bible also says God knows everything yet to come, so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby. God can stop this put he doesnt interecpt dirrectly with our choices.
