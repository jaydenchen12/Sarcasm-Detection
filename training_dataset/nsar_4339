who wouldn't choose to go to heaven if such a place actually existed? there is no lock on the pearly-gates. that is what it means to be all-loving and all-forgiving as well. i know, you're going to say that people are refusing to go when they don't accept god, jesus into their lives. that is irelevant. you are placing that condition on it again and thus cheapening it.
