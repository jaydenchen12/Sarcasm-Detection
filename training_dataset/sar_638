I didn't realize you could just summarily disregard a poster's source without providing any info to back this up. You then proceed to attempt to refute unkerpaulie's points but fail to provide any source to support your claims. As far as I can tell you aren't a medical professional who specializes in pre-natal care and development so your argument can't really stand up to criticism on its own. Your can only refute another's points if you have solid data to back them up.
