2005 publicized aid to Israel was $5-billion, about average for that country. That doesn't include $28-billion in 2002 to fight terrorism, with subsequent yearly amounts classified and not for publication. The US also picks up about 50% of Israel's ongoing deficits and trade imbalances in the form of Israeli debt for Israel to maintain a small positive payment balance for trade credit and public confidence purposes. Pull those numbers from their primarily transactional GDP and problems would quickly appear cumulating with that spiral effect.  Over 30% of present Israeli GDP in public service is difficult to fund from domestic tax revenues, presently the highest in the free world, without incurring abnormal debt. Israel is riding on the coattails of US elastic debt policy.
