i don't think personal attacks are the route to take, but i may be too nice :p i would emphasize that while the fetus does have importance as a potential member of our society, when the woman becomes pregnant we have to deal with what it is. with no consciousness it is not a moral entity that we have obligation to it, or at least our obligation cannot be as great as we owe the woman as an autonomous individual.
