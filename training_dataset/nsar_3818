i don't think lindsay lohan is a good example of any group of people... when i was younger i worked in retail and thieves were everywhere... they just stole because they wanted stuff they couldn't afford. depends on what they were stealing while you worked in retail. and even if they did steal them, did they steal them to have them or to sell them for cash they could use on things they needed? you wouldn't know unless you followed their tracks after they stole. not to be a complete ass, but what you're saying sounds a lot like the corporate propaganda i've been hearing for years that encourages our culture to take a giant shit on the poor and law-breakers.
