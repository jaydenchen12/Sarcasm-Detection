It's been a long standing standard that if the only motivation for a law, act, etc is religious, then it's a violation of SOCAS. If a proposed law just happens to agree with your religion, or if religion is just one small part of the motivation, then it's not a problem. But if you take out religion and you're left with pretty much nothing, then you've got an issue.
