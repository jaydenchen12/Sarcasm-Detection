so let me get this straight, you reject global warming, despite there being supported by almost 97% of scientists and is clearly being observed by the melting of glaciers, rise in sea levels, change in weather patterns, etc. but you believe in a magical genie in the sky that grants your wishes? people like you are gonna get us all killed , keep your stupid superstitions to yourself and please, if you ever have any children, dont spread this bull, ok? thank you
