I have been reading some of the replies on this page, and yes there is a very new valid way that creationists can explain the fact that we see stars that are billions of light years away in a universe that is thousands of years old. This problem is appearently solved by Dr Russell Humphreys new "Relativistic Cosmology" in which he out lines in the book "Starlight and Time."
