Archie,But since you brought it up, do you want to back this statement up capo? Where have I ever claimed to know all that God knows? How about this from your #148 in Gay Rights:I have spoken of the coming judgment that America is facing because of our iniquity and you are proving just how deserving we are of it with your rebellious and condemning attitude towards the God who holds your very life in His hands. You are showing that you don't appreciate his Grace which He has covered America with for so long, so let's see how you feel when He withdraws His Spirit of Grace from this Country and we implode as a Nation. Why do I think that your next post will dwell on your use of the word all?
