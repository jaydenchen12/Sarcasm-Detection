Well insults. No I'm not suprised I wish I could put my hands on the pol on firearms ownership that put the % of dems that owned guns was around 46%. Rep. was around 58% and independants were around 52%. What I was supprised at was that way this person feels that the reason libs need to be armed is the defend them selves from a conservative government. Where as we beleave it is to defend our selves against any and all forms of government. And for a lib to actualy say that they were wrong about anything is a big step.
