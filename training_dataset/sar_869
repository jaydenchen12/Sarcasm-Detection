If Creationism replaced science? First, we'd have to discard the fact that the Earth is billions of years old. Second, we'd have to discard the facts of the order of appearance of organisms, and switch back to the incorrect chronology listed in Genesis. Third, we'd have to reclassify bats as birds. Fourth, we'd have to scrap the fully supported fact and theory of evolution. Fifth, we'd have to go back to believing that people think with their hearts. And so on, and so on.
