lets back up a moment here, ez. first you would have to prove that iran is aiding and abetting terrorists. then you would also have to prove thy are producing nuclear weapons. i'd really like to see your evidence for this. warmongers like you are what got us into the mess that is iraq, ad we don't need another invasion anytime soon - especially for something that is not even proven and hasn't even happened. i take their words at face value until they prove otherwise - must i remind you again : 'innocent until proven guilty'?
