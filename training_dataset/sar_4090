no, a valid general definition of evolution would be 'descent with modification.' keep that stupid 'complex' or 'better' xxxx out of it, because those terms don't mean anything. tell that to all the theistic evolutionists. how many times have i used that word in this post? once, and only to clarify your mistaken definition. the asa has a faith statement, a bit like that of aig or icr, that pretty effectively shows how mistaken you are. my purpose behind posting the link was merely to counter the ridiculous claim that evolution is necessarily atheistic. the asa faith statement above supports my position.
