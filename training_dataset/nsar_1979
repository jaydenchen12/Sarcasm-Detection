By golly!A day doesn't go by in the great and wonderful United States of America that another shooting doesn't occur, with a number of deaths and serious wounds. Isn't America wonderful? That we get to carry around a whole bunch of guns and go out every day and kill and maim?Wonderful work! NRA! Every time I see another story about another shooting in America, sometimes ever two or three shootouts and killings, it absolutely thrills me because I know that the NRA has armed even more Americans and more Americans can now go out and shoot and kill and maim.So, carry on, NRA! I know you're working on that wonderful time when every time a new baby is born in this country, right after a baby takes its first breath, a gun will be placed in his or her tiny hand.
