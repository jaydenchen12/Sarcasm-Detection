The term 'bear arms' usually referred military service at the time of the writing of the second amendment. This is evident from the first draft of the second amendment in which James Madison states, 'no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person.' Although the pro-gun lobby likes to equate 'bearing arms' with carrying a gun, to James Madison the term meant 'to render military service.' Lastly, what arms were they founders referring to? Muskets, not machine guns, semi-automatic assault rifles nor Uzis. Obviously, using the second amendment to oppose laws regulating such weapons is highly questionably."
