What's the scoop here?It seems to me with all the shootings that occur in the United States because of all the gun happy nuts running around, everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting.Good idea simone, when do you start your training.I understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they're deep. There's also the massive loss of blood; To be sure, the massive bleeding would wash out nasty debris but a body can't stand to lose a bunch of blood.
