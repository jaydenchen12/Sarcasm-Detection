It seems that the creationists are beginning to change there views.evolution can be explained by science but creation relys on myth, superstition and hope, but few people are now suggesting that the two theories can be explained together, god started everything then evolution took over.Its like the creationist is trying to put one over the evolutionist by suggesting that god created evolution.But in reality i think a person who believes in creation is coming to terms that the creation theory is a bit far fetched and the evolution theory makes more sense, but due to religious conditioning still continue to grasp on the creation theory.Which really means the bible would be disregarded as a source of information.
