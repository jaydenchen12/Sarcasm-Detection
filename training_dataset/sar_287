So the start of personhood for a particular person is a variable, based on that individual's memory. Twenty years ago I could remember events at my fourth birthday, but today those memories are gone. For a while I had personhood at 4 years of age, but today, looking back, I did not have personhood until I was 6. As I age and my memory fails, it may turn out that I did not have personhood until I was 21 years old. Personnhood comes and goes.Do I have it right?‰ÛNot aware‰Û???????Not aware of what?Shoot a gun behind them and they will flinch. They are aware of loud noises.Throw them wildly into the air and they will cry. They are aware of their own movement.Pinch them, they will cry.They are self aware as they chew on their toes.And of course puppies are aware as well.Unless of course I do not understand what you mean by aware.
