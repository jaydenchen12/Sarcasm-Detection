cute, but not quite. the claim is that we want everybody to have guns. so i'd like to see some proof that gun owners have called for the repealing of the federal age limit that covers the purchase of firearms, and for the prohibited persons list that keeps felons, the insane, the drug addicted, and those that beat their wives, from legally buying guns. if those of my chosen party have made the claims that we want criminals, terrorists and the others in these categories to have guns, then i'd like to see them. otherwise the claim that we want everybody armed is nothing more than a lie. the private property of whom? we have security stops along the mexican/american border to search for drugs and other contraband. how is it not possible on the way to and from dc?
