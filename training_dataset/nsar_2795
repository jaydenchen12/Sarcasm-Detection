Science is different. In science it's a matter of who has the most convincing evidence. If we are to give Christianity the benefit of the doubt and allow it to throw its own evidence into the list of candidates, can you HONESTLY tell me that creationsim is the best answer? If so (and I extend the challenge I made to Lappster) educate and enlighten us. I am eager (as always) to read the evidence for myself.
