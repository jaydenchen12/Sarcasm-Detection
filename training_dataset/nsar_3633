you didn't answer my question.....toe says all structures evolved by small, random modifications. surely, then you are not saying that whole structures such as feet formed complete...that would be a contradiction now wouldn't it.....so answer my question: what about the feet? which foot came first? there are more to feet and other body parts besides bone...muscles, tendons, toenails....did all these evolve at the same time from the same mutation?...if not, in which order?
