Bingo. This is spot on. Why suggest a repeal of the entirety of DOMA if you support the policy established by part of DOMA? And I repeat my earlier observation: if DOMA is such a travesty, why not go ahead and try to repeal it as a Senator. Such a repeal would have to be initiated by Congress anyway. It's highly unlikely that he could accomplish a repeal of DOMA as President.
