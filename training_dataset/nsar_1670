I suspect that a lot of people, if not most people, at least partially follow some version of "treat others as you would have yourself be treated". When, as children, we were scolded "How would you like it if ..." that is a tactic of teaching this rule. For those who are religious (which I only marginally, occasionally and hesitatingly am), even Jesus stated "Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you." in the Sermon on the Mount talk (as quoted by ShadowPikachu). Many world religions and philosophies seem to incorporate that general rule, which is partly why I think it has a reasonable chance at being incorporated as a global base of morality.
