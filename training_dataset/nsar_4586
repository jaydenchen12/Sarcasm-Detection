this makes no sense. bet does not exist to be exclusive entertainment for blacks. it is ethno-centric programming. and not very good at that (tv1 is better). for there to be a 'white' channel, at least along the lines of what bet is aiming to do, there would have to be a single 'white' culture, which there isn't. and bet does not exclude whites from its programming.  your statement seems flat out racist to me. as i said previously, 'tookie's' defenders seem to be overzealous in their defense of the man (i can only take your word for it since i really haven't been paying much attention), but i do not see how their accusations have anything to do with hate crimes, and your perceptions of how they're enforced.
