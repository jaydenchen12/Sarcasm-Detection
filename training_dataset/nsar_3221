Were you hung-over? I can tear up to the most silly programes when hung-over. Heck, I once cried to a re-run of "XXXXX eye for a straight guy" (or something.. I`m not sure about name in english)... I was mighty hung-over though. Note that I`m not saying there is anything wrong with displaying emotions unless your drunk or hung-over, I cry even when I`m not hung-over I`ve just noticed this weird relationship between movies or tv-shows, crying and hang-overs.
