holy shit :( that's why i never take stuff from people i barely know. i know a guy who got tricked into smoking crack.  i successfully quit smoking, and hope to re-kick my caffeine habit. weed was by far the hardest for me to quit, since it kind of immerses you in the subculture. you end up having to cut people off from your life, because peer pressure really isn't a myth. in fact, weed is the only drug people ever try to insist i use. i guess it's because it's perceived as harmless.
