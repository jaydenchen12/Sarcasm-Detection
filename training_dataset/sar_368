The law applies equally to everyone. Religious people cannot discriminate outside of a church, as the printer tried to do. Bishop Henry's comments were indeed hateful, not religious. There are laws against willful promotion of hatred. This type of speech has legal limits. This does not mean all hate speech will be illegal, only that there are limits. I suppose you thought his comments about the state using it's coersive power against gays, was very Christian? Would it not be more Nazi?
