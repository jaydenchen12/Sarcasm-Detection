It appears to me, that if slavery had been put up to a vote in Texas back before the civil war, and Texans voted to add an amendment to their state constitution legalizing slavery of blacks (which they would have), you could as simply say "Maybe, just maybe, the reason that many American people think slavery of blacks is right is simply because it IS."
