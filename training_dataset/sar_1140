i could care less if i shower with a lesbian. i am sure i have at the gym. one of my olderst friends is a lesbian and we have seen each other naked many times. she has never gawked or hit on me. she knows i am straight. i have been hit on by women and men i am not interested in. i say 'thanks, but no thanks.' i have only ever had one lesbian contnue after that, the number of men that wouldn't let it rest are beyond count. but overall, i think women have a lot more tact in such matters. as to the whole naked thing. we are so puritanical about nudity in the us. when i spent a month in finland i saw people of all sizes, ages, colors and genders naked all the time due to the saunas and jumping into lakes. it was in no way sexual. as far as separating men and women's showers i mostly see that as a safety issue for women. sexual assualt is a very real danger for women (1 in 3 will experience it in her lifetime). although i believe most men are not rapists, especially those in uniform, having men and women shower together has the potential of putting women in a very vulnerable situation as most men are physically stronger than most women.  i don't believe this. i am as worried about it as i am that stepping on a crack will break my mother's back. stop fretting. gay men probably find homophobes about as appealing a black woman would find a memeber of the kkk. hell, i am a straight woman and find your ignorance and paranioa of the matter decidedly unattractive.  neo-con, religious wing nuts. they are so entertaining.
