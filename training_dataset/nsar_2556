Don't you dare try and give me a lecture about cherry picking! All you ever do is cherry pick! You come around about once a month, scour the news to find a crime committed with a gun, and you use that single incident as if it's evidence that there's a serious problem that threatens the entire nation. If that's not cherry picking then I don't know what is. As a gun owner I'm also a property owner. Or are you denying that guns are property?
