it should just be 'stick butter,' that's more descriptive of the actual function. and the mold for the butter should be the shape of a penis. however, i don't know if i want my lube to be the consistency of butter. i like the fact that lube is just watery because its easy to wash off. butter takes more time and scrubbing action to get off... and if it's a wild night you might spend a while in the shower. how would you achieve a substance malleable enough to be formed into a stick, yet easy to wash off? and edible, so no silicone or anything. lube also washes out of fabric pretty easily, and this might not. panties are expensive...
