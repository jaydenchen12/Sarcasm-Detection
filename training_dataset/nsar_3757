yes, we have. a student with a 3.9 gpa and a low sat and/or act score will get relative piddle for academic scholarships. wait, you're a parent? and you think that sat/act performance two or three years down the road serves as sufficient motivation to freshmen in lieu of grades? you think grades aren't necessary to help teachers see how their students are learning? i agree that the gpa system can be misleading, but devoid of an alternative, we have to keep it.
