No it f****n' isn't! If that was the case then Plessy v. Ferguson should have been used as precedent for all the following cases that dealt with segregation and racism. In Plessy the Supreme Court ruled that black men weren't entitled to the same facilities as white men, rather they had to have their own private facilities, separate from those of white men.Forget precedent, the Supreme Court should instead focus on what is truly constitutional regardless of what previous judges have ruled.
