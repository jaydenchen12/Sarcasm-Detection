The Houston Museum of Natural Science (HMNS) has announced that "Lucy" will be making a tour of the U.S. She will begin, for the first time ever outside of Ethiopia, at the HMNS in 2006 and then visit other major science museums in the years following. Since I live in Houston and am a member of the HMNS, I'll be able to see her first hand.
