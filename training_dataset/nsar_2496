Now look here, boy, I'm tired of you spreading this ignorant bull****. I came from the UK, I lived there most of my life, I saw the truth that you choose to ignore because it's inconvenient for you.The police have been caught intentionally miscounting the number of crimes reported by the people, they've been doing it for years. The people of the UK also don't report every instance of when they've been victimized. These two facts mean that any evidence you use to support your flawed position is untrustworthy and doctored to reflect whatever you want it to. You might as well be citing yourself!Even one of the biggest advocates of the post-Dunblane handgun ban admitted that the ban was a huge failure, because even school children were able to get access to guns and kill their classmates.Don't you ever spread this lie again, we know that there's no ounce of truth to it! And that's coming from a former subject of the UK, somebody who saw it first hand!
