The definition of deter is "To prevent or discourage from acting, as by means of fear or doubt". A lock does nothing to induce fear or doubt in an attacker, all it can do is slow them down. As said before the best lock is only as strong as the door and screws used to hold it in place, so their effectiveness is highly questionable.
