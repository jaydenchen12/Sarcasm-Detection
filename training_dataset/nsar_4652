it may help to look at election in this way (wow, i almost wrote evolution emoticonxic)... god is deserving of all glory. in fact, because god is ultimate perfection, he seeks to glorify himself. because humans are not god, we are not deserving of his glory. in order for god to demonstrate his glory, through his characteristic of justice, he allows us to go to hell. however, another characteristic of his glory is that he is merciful. in his mercy he chooses some to be saved and with him in heaven. thus two of his characteristics are being glorified (mercy and justice).
