that's not cannibalism. if it were cannibalism jesus wouldn't have walked away from the meal. or did that cross your mind?  the catholic church wasn't the first church, unless you can show me that in the book of acts, or the gospels. it's not what they claim, but what we see in history. i imagine a great many catholics will get to heaven before you will. once again - and get this through your noggin - i base my beliefs on what's in the gospels and the new testament. john 3:36
