The term GAY was adopted by the homosexual movement in the hope of evoking a happy existence and persona to the general public that rightfully saw your community for the pathetic self centered existence that it still represents. You may have bought into that image lesz, but I can plainly and clearly see the full extent of the misery index which comes with the homosexual lifestyle. So your claim that your perceived, promoted and alleged happiness as a people is as foolish as your insistence that homosexuality is as right and normal as heterosexuality which is the reason our species is self perpetuating.http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1...229518,00.html
