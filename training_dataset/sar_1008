As for the extremely rare case where a womans life is at risk because of the baby and she has to choose between herself or the child which could result in possible death for both. Who am I to say what decision she should make. That is a horrible thing for someone to have to choose. I do know, however, that my wife almost died during pregnancy and right after pregnancy because of the baby and she would have never chose herself.
