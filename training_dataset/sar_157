Are you saying the government SHOULDN'T have known about a Category 4 hurricane hitting New Orleans and then breaking the levees after the hurricane passed causing the city to flood and trap people in the Super Dome with people still in the city? haha, they should have known that...Bush hates black people and is for Big hurricanes (not just big oil) and his lack of enviromental policy clearly caused this.emoticonXRolleyes
