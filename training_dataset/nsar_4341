  reading this synopsis  it looks like due process, which means california will have to fight each and every infringement on the books. pretty much, exactly what i thought, and the article about what this means for california thought, might end up to be the case.  every time california wants a new law, it will have to go back to court to see if it will be allowed.  california just might be the proving ground for the lower limits of what the supreme court will allow our bill of rights to mean.  california. you are yet again the lowest common denominator. emoticonxsmilie joke!
