for the teleporter, i agree that you would be dead. i am not trying to argue that 'you' would ever cease to be dead when the new you was created. i believe that you would be dead the moment your body was destroyed, and when it was rebuilt, that would not be you. if two such clones were created, then there would be two clones, but neither would be you. this is why i am saying that who we are is more than our physical selves, indeed the teleporter example seems to prove it, therefore we are also our frame of reference. yes, your brain and your senses change to a degree, but your frame of reference remains that of wraith, which is why you remain you your entire life.
