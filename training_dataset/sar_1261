USA number #1 in another category.But think of the influence the US gains from having foreign governments and corporations owning more of US debt. Think of the flexibility the US has in regards to budgets with a higher debt load eating more of the budget in service costs. Think of the huge new markets for US companies in Asia, to make, and sell in Asia. Think of the US's transistion to a new economy where every one works in a service sector and the strength of the US manufacturing industry (pride of the world).
