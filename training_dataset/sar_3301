forget tictaalik, how about the modern walking fish, after all he's still here. here, watch the video. http://www.csiro.au/promos/ozadvance...shwalkmov.html so tell me did your walking fish have lungs? did it breathe air or walk on land? can you prove that aspect of your claim? of course you can't but you will claim it anyway wont you.
