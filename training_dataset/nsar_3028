Read these storys of self defence and then tell me Brady how you can justify theseThe injustice of the British ban on self defenseMaking matters worse, the British legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them. An example is the Tony Martin case:Tony Martin was a farmer, whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times. Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar. When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home, Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun. The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed, and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg. Later on that day, the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent. At trial, Martin argued that he had acted in self defense, but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence. The surviving criminal, who had over 30 criminal convictions, then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary. The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he ‰ÛÏhas shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars.‰Û Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home.Another example, from 2009, also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims:A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home ‰ÛÒ while the criminal went free. Munir Hussain, who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year, was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve ‰ÛÏcivilised society‰Û. But Walid Salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing. He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain, his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe, Bucks, on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque, Reading Crown Court heard. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room. But when Hussain's teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he seized his chance and turned on his captors. . . The brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in September. Sentencing, Judge John Reddihough told them it was his ‰ÛÏpublic duty‰Û to jailing Munir Hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months.This one is quite nice as wellCleared: Builder who chopped off thug's ear with Samurai sword after he threatened to rape and kill his family | Mail OnlineWell thank god for the gun ban in england.
