The Civil Union argument is a disingenuous one.Those people who are fighting against the rights of gays to marry do not want to see same-sex couples receive any rights or recognitions of their relationships. The authors of all those constitutional amendments ensured that there were no recognition of any other types of relationships in their wording.Why should any of us settle for something that these very same people are going to attempt to deny anyway?
