i don't know what you would call it. you use a variety of english i am not familiar with. perhaps dna contains just 'codes', 'facts' or 'blueprints'? since you insist on defining words in extremely odd ways, i have no idea what you'd term an undesigned, complex, self-replicating system. emoticonxrolleyes read your own links. even the creationist websites you cite don't support your exceptionally ignorant claims. at least it is clear now where you have stolen your ideas about information. you have taken a rather shady piece of creationist work, digested it poorly, and spewed it out on this forum. living things do not neccessarily contain dna.
