the car crash analogy only goes so far. the consequence of a car crash is merely damaged property.  not all unwanted pregnancies are due to unprotected sex or irresponsibility, contraception can fail. humans are sexual beings, they have sex (something some posters may understand some day if he ever have sex) and pregnancy can occur despite the best of precautions. the puritan expects everyone to be celibate until marriage. not all people get married. also, unwanted pregnancies also occur within marriage. i totally understand the concept of being responsible, but the consequences of a pregnancy or an unwanted child can be devastating to a woman or a couple. it is naive, simplistic and yes, punitive, to simply conclude that the woman should 'face the consequences.'
