yes, particuarly if you understand the puns in the original hebrew.  adam (mankind) is related to the word (adamah), which means 'red clay'. this is in turn releated to the word edom , which means 'blood'.  the word translated as 'created' is more like the term 'formed', as a potter forms a piece of clay.  so, if you look at it properly, we can see that genesis is saying 'god formed man as a potter forms clay out of flesh and blood'.  the word 'eve' is the word for love. so we can also point out that 'god formed man out of flesh and blood, and gave him love for companionship. that is all without going into the political comentary about conditions between the various cultures at the time.
