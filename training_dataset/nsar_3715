maybe from 1986, i'm a mite older than that. they can't pass a retroactive law now can they? mine still says, 'not for identification purposes'. think they can make that ex post facto? even the county clerk isn't entitled to that information. my birth certificate doesn't have it either, maybe obama's does if we can find the birth certificate and heel print ? when clinton was president, he and lloyd bentsen and his fed chief bundled up all the ss money and sold them off as securities. long before 1986, the ss money was removed from the account and put in the general fund so they could spend it. look up what date registration became mandatory and try not to be too surprised.
