nope.  the first part is factual. only those who want to see saddam as a martyr will do so.  the last part are currently 3 types who seem to be calling him one. the only one's who've called him a martyr in the hours of media on this subject i've covered have been small bands of his former followers, a daughter in jordan iirc in a protest...and liberals and the media who repeat such claims.
