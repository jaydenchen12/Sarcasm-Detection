RTL backed three bills that were recently passed in the Georgia Senate:One requires an ultrasound prior to abortion.Another protects pharmacists if they refuse to fill prescriptions for drugs that end pregnancies.The third allows prosecutors to charge people with causing the death of a fetus, REGARDLESS OF THE STAGE OF PREGNANCY.*******************I think the first will make legal abortions more expensive and will add to the number of backroom botchjobs, the second will have little affect on anything, the third will renew the argument relating to when life begins.
