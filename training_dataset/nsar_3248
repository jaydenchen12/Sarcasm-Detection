2. preventing a poor/unhappy life, 2. You have no idea whether the unborn will be 'unhappy', or even poor, for their lifetime. It would be more sensible to evaluate a person's life at, age 10 perhaps, and then kill them if they have been unhappy and are likey to continue. Again, anyone on welfare is a likely target. In fact, it might be expedient to simply nuke the poorest parts of the world.
