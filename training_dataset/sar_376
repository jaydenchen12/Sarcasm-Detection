I have no idea what mechanism/explanation you favour wrt biological evolution, but if it is the Random, spontaneously generated, coincidental to organismic need, plus local, accidental, cull by chance environmental factor "Natural Selection" notion, then here's a surprise alert for you--you believe in a notion that is intrinsically and essentially chance-based, that is, a notio9n that not only involves random accidents, but one that involves nothing but random, local, and anomalous accidents. There are no universal forces , such as gravity, electro-magnetism, weak and strong molecular forces, attached to your, "Natural Selection". Time for you to wake up and smell the coffee. RMNS is nothing better than a childish superstition.
