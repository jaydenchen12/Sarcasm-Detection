The day when you have to walk into that abortion clinic and make that decision, you stand up and tell me what a real man is. Those poor girls and women who go through abortions did what they had to do, more than you could ever do. Don't stand on your high horse and lecture the world on the virtuousness of your position. Don't talk about being virtuous, be virtuous. A "real man" helps those who he loves, whether he likes what they did. A father loves his sons and daughters, despite what they do, rather in spite of what they have done. Good day to you.
