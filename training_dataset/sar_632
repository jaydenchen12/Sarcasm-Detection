Families can multiply a lot faster than you think. I'm not sure of the correct time, but there is nothing that says it couldn't have happened in that time period. The incestually conceived sons went out and found other people and married whom they pleased. They could have married a women who had children, and had even more children. Then they could have returned.That area that was so populated was nothing when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, and any people living around it left. Why else would Lot's daughters commit incest to bring forth children?
