I was doing some work with a friend of mine at the Geological Survey of Canada on Friday, and the topic of ANWR came up. Apparently the Canadian Gov't is in the middle of a large study of the hydrocarbon reserve potential in the Mackenzie/Beaufort region right now. It's internally confidential, and, seeing as how I work for an oil/gas company, he couldn't give me details.Suffice to say, in his opinion, it didn't look real promising, data was very limited, and given what was available, any estimates are pretty shaky. His biggest concern was that the source rocks appeared immature.Waxy
