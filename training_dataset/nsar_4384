Nope, your argument fails again. Nothing in the Heller ruling suggests that gun rationing laws are constitutional in nature. At best Heller was simply saying that the individual rights nature of the Second Amendment doesn't automatically rule all gun control null and void. But then again nobody was really expecting it to. The details of what is allowable and what isn't haven't been hammered out yet. But I would love to see you try and explain how 30 months in prison, a felony conviction record, and $5,000 in fines for buying two guns in one month is fair, reasonable, tough on crime, and constitutional in nature. Go ahead and try. We'll wait.
