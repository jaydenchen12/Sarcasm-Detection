Note also this false statement from a ""Survival of the fittest" is a poor way to think about evolution. Darwin himself never used the phrase. What Darwin said is that heritable variations lead to differential reproductive success. This is not circular or tautologous. It is a prediction which can be, and has been, experimentally verified [Weiner 1994]."http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA500.htmlThis is quite clearly wrong as Darwin did use it in the 6th ed of Species.
