Some argue that the mountains weren't that tall yet. That makes no sense whatsoever given the rates of tectonic plate drift. Plates move at 1 inch a year. That's 500 feet over 6,000 years. Everest is by far taller then that. Some argue that plates moved faster. To create Everest in 6,000 years would mean plates would have to move almost five feet every year in the same direction. While plate movements are related to the Earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. That's way more then the surface of the Sun.
