if something happens to the people who are named on the website as a direct result of the website then i would say a great deal of justice is due and the burden of guilt is on the one who runs the website. maybe i should give a list of all the homosexuals in my community to a group of drunk rednecks... this is as bad as the registered sex offender list.
