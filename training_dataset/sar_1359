I saw the same thing amongst the Jehovah's Witnesses. They even encouraged it. Get, married - get a job. They also strongly discourage post-secondary education. Its like they knew that once these kids hit college they would a) get too horny, b) find reasons to question their faith. But then the Witnesses are absolutely whacked. So are the Mormons.
