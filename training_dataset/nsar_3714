we went to the parade downtown first off, which was actually pretty good for here. after that, we hung out at home for a few hours and then headed up to a friend's cabin at eklutna for a mexican fiesta and some fireworks, fireworks that didn't start until 1:00 in the morning, but they were pretty cool for a private fireworks show. fun day!
