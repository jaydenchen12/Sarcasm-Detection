I believed and hoped in the possibility.It was Jesus, the living son of God.. he had feet, hands, legs - he had a body yes.I never looked at his face, but i knew who it was - for one thing nobody walks around in robes anywhere near where I live. I could also see the marks on his feet when I got up close... My friends who were with me did not see him, but I am not suprised they were engrossed in their conversation, I left their side and they did not realise I had left.
