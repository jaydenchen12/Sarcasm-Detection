So of you pro-choice people confuse the heck out of me. You go on and on about a women's choice when it comes to her body and how everyone else should stay the heck out of her business but then when people want to own weapons for personal defense/usuage. People that haven't committed crimes and have been physiologically examined. You go: NO! That's WRONG! You can't have your choice! I'm being affected by it! (Even when its obvious NO you are not being effected by their choice to bear arms) And you lot call pro-lifers hypocritical for being pro-death penalty. Pfft.
