no. i will quote myself here: anything we do at this point to attempt a 'bailout' will have a net result of putting more people in hoovervilles and eating out of dumpsters. i am advocating not trying to throw trillions of dollars at a problem that cannot be solved just by throwing money at it, thus keeping the number of hooverville dumpster divers to a minimum.
