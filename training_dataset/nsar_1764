Now we come to the problem with the "theory" of intelligent design. There simply has been no thinking involved. The equivalent of ID is doing all the experiments with the apple, measuring the mass of the apple and the Earth, and figuring out gravity, publishing it, and the public supporting that hypothesis with their experiments, with no refutations or flaws, and then some people coming along and saying, "well maybe magic fairies caused the apple to fall just the way it does, ever think of that? We should teach them that this is a valid alternative to gravity." I also offer you this for humor: http://www.venganza.org/
