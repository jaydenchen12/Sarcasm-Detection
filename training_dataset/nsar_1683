most research indicates social deprivation as being main causes of crime coupled nowadays with drugsSO WHY ARE GUNS BEING BLAMED FOR CAUSING CRIME!!! I've been saying this for years...Criminals have always had guns ban or notThat is the exact point of this thread... guns bans/control doesn't stop the criminals, endangering the populace.If you want to argue anti-gun... don't support the side of us "redneck-hillbilly-gunnuts" that you think are so stupid.
