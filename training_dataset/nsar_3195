how can family values shift in a nation withint 10 years?? 10 years ago america would have never thought they wouldve needed to put Marriage Ammendments on the ballot let alone have less than 60% of the people actually vote for it. ITs sad to see a nation degrade exponentially fast and not to mention the people's consciences getting seared at the same time.Its kinda like the germans after slow and steady progress of the nazi party changed the whole nation's perspective on the jews. people that were against the nazi party 5 years prior found themselves turning jews into concentration camps. i see a similar progression beginning in america to the point that this comment itself will be bashed by those on here whose conscience has been seared to the point that they think 2 men being married is ok. If everyone in the world was gay, the human race would become extinct.Edit/Delete Message Reply With Quote
