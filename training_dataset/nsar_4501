if a police officer can't tell that something like this is obviously a toy, then they have no business being police to begin with. first, how is this even relevant to the discussion? second, why should we believe that it's correct? please tell me you aren't counting gang bangers and violent youth as children. in the state of maryland, and dc according to the study. hardly a reliable source for such a survey. again, what's the relevancy to this?
