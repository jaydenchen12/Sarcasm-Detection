The thing is, though, that if marriage is privatized people can have freedom without "redefining the standard." It is a way for us to allow all those oddball marriages without putting an "official stamp of approval" on them. Liberals want to expand the government involvement in marriage to include gay marriages, thus putting society's approval on these things (something that gets moralists very angry.)Conservatives want to continue the statist rewards for straight marriage only - a violation of the 14th amendment.Libertarians combine the best of both positions. Their position (privatization) creates the freedom to marry, upholds the Constitution, and avoids official approval of gay marriage at the same time.
