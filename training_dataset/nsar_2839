why do you make such a big issue of this? if you're in this forum, and you've seen this post, then creation vs evolution obviously strikes a nerve with you- why?! what is so fascinating about something you'll never live long enough to witness if it does exist and that you've seen all there is to see of if it doesn't exist?does anyone here really lack in something to validate themselves so much that they have to turn to a bunch of dead animals to find a reason for living?
