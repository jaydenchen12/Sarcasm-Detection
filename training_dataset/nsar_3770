of course it is known that wild animals that are sick just die from natural selection(they get eaten, or they don't manage to find food) and even livestock, if it has some disease, can be culled to prevent outbreak of disease. in humans it is different though, there are quarantine zones to prevent spread of certain disease. however, religion is sort of disease, but mind disease which can't be prevented to spread by some quarantine, but only by some great culling, and restricting it's spreading. religion is so embedded within (weak) human mind that it can't be removed normally(e.g. non violently, as those emotional weaklings would call it) but only by eradication.
