no, god loves me so much that he sent his son to earth to pay the penalty for my sins. past, present and future. i have eternal life now, based on the promises in god's word. i also know that, like a loving father, god disciplines me to get me back on track and in line with his will. i'ts true that god loves you, but god cannot accept you the way you are now. if and when you discover who god really is, then you will understand that god changes people from within. god wants you to come to him, but on his terms, not yours.
