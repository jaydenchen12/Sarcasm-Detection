Tell me about it. They had Kerry winning FL by 2 or 3%, they had Kerry winning PA by double digits, and they had it close in VA and SC. Needless to say, Bush won FL by 7% (9% different than the exit polls), Kerry won PA by 2% (at least 8% different than the exit polls), and Bush won VA and SC by 10% and 17% respectively.I was reading a good article by Dick Morris about the apparent bias in the exit polls. He actually called Kerry to win it easy after looking at the exit polls. Turns out, they were terrible. He said that exit polls are nearly always right or very, very close. There is no possible way they could "accidentally" be so off the end result.
