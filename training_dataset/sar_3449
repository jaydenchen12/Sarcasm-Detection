clearly is not necessarily correctly! even though his statement is convoluted, your calculation based on it, is correct. however, it is more easily understood as: (pop a)x.06=(pop b)x.44 (pop b)/(pop a)=.06/.44=.1364=13.64% one should remember, too, that (pop b) is still part of (pop a). however, i think the claim is more than slightly exaggerated. the prison population can't have increased that much since 2003, when it was 482 per 100,000, or about 0.4%. the nearly 14% number is obviously too high. the prison population was roughly 1.47 million in 2004. with a population of roughly 295,000,000, this means 1.47/295=0.5% of the population is in prison. a far cry from 13.64% http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/popclock http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/...n-prison_x.htm ...and this site says 645 out of 100,000 or 645/100,000=0.0065=0.65% ..still miles from 13.64%
