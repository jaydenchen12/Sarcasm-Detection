although it must be noted that some percentage of the weapons that were not traceable could well have come from north of the border as well. then there's the weapons we were not asked to trace. do we know where those came from? in truth, the actual percentage of weapons in the hands of gangs and cartels that originate in the u.s. will likely never be known. how many u.s. prosecutions will result from even the 17%?  will that be dealers or 'straw purchasers'?
