i'm incredibly surprised you haven't got it now, especially as you put your stance as 'libertarian'. i am not a libertarian because i want to legalize drugs and prostitution or remove the age limit on alcohol and cigarettes. if the definition of libertarian has became that, the world is seriously screwed up. i am a libertarian because in my country, the taxes are above abnormal. 50-65% for an average salary, and up to 80% for a ''millionaire'' basically no one can be rich in my country. every time i get my salary, i am looking really forward to it. i work hard for my money, but it is tearing me down mentally, that half my money is taken away to pay for some alcoholic who is to drunk to get his money himself. it is killing the working spirit in me, and several others. that's why i am a libertarian.
