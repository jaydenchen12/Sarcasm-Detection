Don't be silly--no one is voting your family out of existence. Though it might make a fascinating Criss Angel or David Blane trick. This is simply about whether or not any group that wants to come along and redefine marriage should get to do so. I agree it's not an 'academic exercise', but not for the same reason you think.I no more take 'pleasure and joy' from something like this than any other public act of due process, e.g. voting to change the speed limit.Frankly, I've always thought it was pretty odd--if not downright disturbing--that some gay pride proponents seem to hold up the legality of their union as the determinant of their joy and emotion, when they are completely free to have whatever union they want regardless. After all, no one's going to block the door to the chapel, and I can guarantee you I'd be joyfully married with or without that piece of paper called a license.
