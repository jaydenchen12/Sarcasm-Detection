i thought it was common knowledge that merv was gay. it may have been an opinion piece (as are all blogs), but he indicated he researched these facts for a book he had written. signorile is no slouch. he is a respected writer. certainly strongly opinionated, but he backs his opinions up. this is not a fox 'news' piece. how does telling the truth prevent the guy from resting in peace?
