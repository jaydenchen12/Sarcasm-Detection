bryan makes a good point though. bloomberg is basically trying to suggest that if we got tough on gun laws here in virginia that the crime rate in new york city would go down. this is pretty doubtful. you never really see someone go 'man, i'd xxxx your head off but guns are too expensive'. instead, people are just smart enough to get guns where it is easiest. should those 10 states suddenly become the hardest states to get guns in than you'd see 10 other states be on that list with the exact same crime rates. the reason we can tell this is that virginia and those other named states do not have higher crime rates than the cities with strict gun laws.
