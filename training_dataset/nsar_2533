unkerpaulieI think your analogy breaks down with a little thought. If I have a check for a million dollars and I take it to a copy machine and make a copy, I am quite aware that the copy will not be perfect. There is an imperfect mechanical divice between the check and the copy. Or are you saying that God has a big imperfect copy machine that he jumps into and out pops an imperfect copy.My thought was that God was the direct agent of creation (without the use of intervening mechanical devices), and being a perfect Being incapable creating imperfection (for then He would not be God), all of His creation would be as perfect as He is.So does this perfect God have a spine that is a plethora of engineering disasters?
