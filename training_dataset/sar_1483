Don't you get it Bassman? lyteboy can raise any issue he likes, but God help the conservative for calling him on his blatant ignorance and bigotry against anything and anyone who dares disagree with his warped view of reality. He doesn't need reason nor a rational thought process in order to attack us. All that is required is that we dare to comment at all. Like a poisonous viper he will strike out without ever considering if what he say's is either true or reasonable.
