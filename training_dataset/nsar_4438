Well, I'm not an atheist, but I definitely don't believe in the bible. However, I don't think the "atheists" or the non-christian believers promote morality. Our issue is only based in the fact that we are a normal part of society and would very much like to have that respect. On the other side, the fundies say they know what's right for everyone and look at us as reprobrates, condemned... blah blah blah. Don't think we're promoting morality. we're not pedophiles, thieves or evil people.... but we're constantly condemned by the moral christianists. I think our side of the moral issue is more of a knee-jerk reaction to the jerks on the fundie side. If someone kicked you constantly, wouldn't you eventually kick back. The problem with the fundies is that when we kick back, it hurts. But they feel justified in what they do.
