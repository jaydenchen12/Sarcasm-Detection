My point in starting the thread is not merely that Christians fall short of their aspirations. No....this is worse. Because this particular U.S. Senator, an avowed conservative Christian, has actively worked to restrict the rights of others to marry, supposedly in the name of "protecting" or "defending" marriage, while at the same time undermining his own marriage. He makes a pretense, for political gain I suspect, of "defending marriage" by playing to people's anti-gay prejudices while himself undermining marriage in his real life. That's hypocrisy, and it's dishonesty.
