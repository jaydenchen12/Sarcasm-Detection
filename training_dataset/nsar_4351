foundit, obviously you have never actually bothered to read the libertarian position on marriage, which is to replace it with contract law, before complaining about it. contract law easily covers phenomena like divorce. if you spent 5 seconds researching the issue you would realise this. your 'one big example' is one big strawman, as usual. and yes, as above, ron paul's position, which is less strong, is to get the federal government out and leave it to the states.
