LOL, are you serious? Nobody wants to force their "religiously prescribed morality" on you. I'm agnostic. I don't subscribe to ANY religion.It is just common sense that murdering an unborn human being is wrong. I don't need religion to tell me that. The debate over abortion really has nothing to do with religion.
