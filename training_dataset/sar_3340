most of his links were in reference to another question. that's partially my doing as i introduced the kerry attack in the wrong thread. i don't like to hijack threads. i'm just addicted to hating kerry because he was pro-communist in the early '70s. maybe he can be appointed ambassador to north vietnam after he loses this election! you dislike my techniques because i point out your propensity to confuse and digress when you try to argue. you come up with more unrelated **** than anyone else on this board. your sense of logic is blinded by your delusions of adequacy. i put little credence in anything you say.
