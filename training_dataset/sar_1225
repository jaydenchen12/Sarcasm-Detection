Of course it will have an effect on the gay marriage issue. It will prevent the people of Mass from voting on the issue and place the final decision in the hands of the Pro Gay Democratic Legislature who is owned and controlled by the Gay Lobby. It should also be noted that according to the Mass Constitution, the people have always voted on such issues. The Democratic Party controlled Government wants to change the Constitution against the will of the people who want to vote on this important issue.It's just another example of the Liberals hijacking the historical political Process and reforming it in their own image.
