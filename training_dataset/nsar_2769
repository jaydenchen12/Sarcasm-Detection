What's the difference between humans and chimps? According to the blowhards in the scientific world for the past 60 years, they said it was genetic mutations. But according to these three articles, including a September 2006 Science article it's cooked food and fire.....you see these things cause our genes to be expressed differently. ...We think gene expression is a major part of what separates chimps and humans," said Kevin White, an associate professor of genetics, ecology and evolution at Yale University in the United States. When we looked at gene expression, we found fairly small changes in 65 million years of macaque, orangutan and chimpanzee evolution," said Dr Yoav Gilad of the University of Chicago, lead author of the study. But he said it was followed by quick changes in specific groups of genes known as transcription factors, which control the expression of other genes, since humans diverged from their ape ancestors during the last 5 million years. "This rapid evolution in transcription factors occurred only in humans," Gilad added in a statement. ...
