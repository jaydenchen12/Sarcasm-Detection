Is this the sort of thing that is being taught at that bastion of liberal science, MIT? How can this be presented as fact rather than theory?New and improved nuclear fuel createdNuclear fission, neutrons and protons, and even the atom itself are just theories. No one has ever seen an atom or a neutron. No one has ever observed an atom split. Why are our liberal news media allowed to present this as fact?Moreover, aren't nuclear reactors designed by intelligent humans? I also notice that this research was funded by our hard earned tax dollars without requiring that the benevolence of God also be researched in equal time. This is yet another shameful example of the godless attitude of science.
