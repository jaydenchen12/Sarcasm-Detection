Sinjin is quite content to register all firearms as has every dictator in history prior to confiscation. His compliments to the current system in kalifornia is nothing short of complete advocacy of registration and confiscation of privately owned firearms. What he doesn't want you to know is the depth of lawlesness and infringement is already in effect and is only working to punish innocent people and has nothing to do with crime control...it is all about ultimate disarmament and loss of Second Amendment rights. There is a word for these people, now what was that?
