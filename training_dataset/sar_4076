reading back through this thread, i realized that i must have missed this post. i'm glad you posted it because although the post is ridiculous, it nevertheless has comedic value. can the government tell someone that they cannot beat their children, even if they choose to beat them only in the privacy of their own home? and further than that, it is an obvious fact that just because something should be in the constitution does not mean it actually is in the constitution.
