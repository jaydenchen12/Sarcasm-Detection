You're missing the bigger picture. I don't see the conflict, BIBLICALLY SPEAKING. Because in the Kingdom of God there is also judgment. Ever read about the Israelis coming under judgment and being enslaved by the Babylonians? Why did that happen to them? BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LOVE GOD AND THEIR NEIGHBORS AS THEMSELVES. They broke the law of love. God didn't break it, they did. So, because they hated and did not turn from their wicked ways, they came under judgment. And if you read the book of Judges, that usually humbles the people and turns their hearts back to God. That's why I say there is no conflict. God's economy makes sense.
