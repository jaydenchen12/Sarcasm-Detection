I have been in several 3rd world countries, and I have never once seen a case where someone would be killed if they didn't convert to Christianity, or even if they did convert from Christianity to Islam. On the other hand, I have seen a number of cases where Muslim family members who converted to Christianity had to flee their family out of fear of death. I would be very interested in reading about or hearing about cases where the reverse is true, but I don't think there are many such cases out there. The issue of witchcraft among Christian churches may be an exception at least to the degree of people and children being ostracized.
