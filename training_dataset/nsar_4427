Wrong. My gasoline prices vary from day to day (especially so, lately) but the retail price of electricity only varies with pronouncements from my state Public Service Commission. The investment capital is available, but ill-considered regulations (particularly those speciously based on the Endangered Species Act) and nuisance lawsuits from the environmental groups make it impossible to employ that capital. For example, we haven't built a new refinery in almost 30 years although people are using more gasoline than ever; a group in Arizona has been trying since 1999 to get the necessary permits for another refinery, but they haven't yet been successful. You're changing the subject. I referred to societal compassion, not government compassion (which I agree is nearly nonexistent - see the Canadian health care system for an awful example of where that leads).
