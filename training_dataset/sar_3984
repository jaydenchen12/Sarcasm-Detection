It's called a technical correction, and if you had any knowledge about these things you would know this. All commodities and equities have gone up substantially over the last year and a correction was in order. Oil broke through a 5 year old resistance line a while back and that usually means that the price is going down even further. I expect oil to be heading towards the mid 40's before going up again after the OPEC production cut at the end of the month. And if you think that inflation has no effect on the price of oil or any other commodity/stock, then you're either ignorant, stupid or both. Inflation affects the price of everything on this planet.
