Well let's look at the facts themselves. Concealed carry laws are now part of the legal system in 48 out of the 50 states in this country. Concealed carry started in Florida and worked their way from one state to another over a continuous 20 year period, and not once has a concealed carry law ever been repealed, for any reason.Gun control laws, like handgun rationing, mandatory reporting standards, ammunition registries, secondary background checks, trigger lock and storage requirements, etc. are limited in their reach, sticking to only certain states. There's been no mass adoption of these laws by various states across the country, and there's even been cases of them being repealed due to ineffectiveness.If gun control laws worked at controlling crime, and the presence of firearms actually had the potential to increase crime rates, these facts would be reversed.
