the california legislature--the people's elected representatives--have, over the last two years, twice voted to legitimise same-sex marriages in california.  that's in the last two years, not eight years ago, when the odious, unconstitutional prop. 22 was passed.  gov. schwarzenegger vetoed it both times, saying--contrary to the usual the 'activist judges' complainants--that he preferred the court to decide. which it has. tough titty.
