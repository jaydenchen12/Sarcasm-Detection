that just shows how nutty it is. using your argument, someone could reject all scientific theories because most of them are wrong: apparently even yec are in this sense more rational than dawkins. the claim that faith is accepted mainly because people are told to is very dodgy. religion seems to naturally arise, although there are many theories as to how and why, religious and otherwise. think of religion like morality: the idea varies, but seems to exist everywhere and often seems to appeal to the same things. it is often 'taught' but this does not mean it does not occur naturally: indeed, a system of explaining away what would otherwise be ethical/religious is needed, and this requires a more direct and deliberate move: thus the cack-handed attempts at replacing religion with deliberate human constructs.
