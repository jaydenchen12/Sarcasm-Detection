rationalization is probably the worst way to prove what you are doing is 'ok'.  this is what you sound like 'well, billy is doing so it is ok for me to do it!'  however, if you think putting down 50% of the people is ok then good luck getting anything passed the real way. well, you are anti my morals, anti family, anti equality, anti american, anti society, anti democratic, i could go on....but you seem to be ok with this. just because you think these people are anti whatever, doesn't make it true and calling them this will further help them solidify these views.  it is so funny to watch you do the same things that you get mad at others for doing.
