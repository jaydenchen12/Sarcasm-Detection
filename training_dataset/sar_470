no i do not think that all life comes from a single-celled ancestor in the distant past. the first reason for this is my faith in the inherent word of god. secondly, throughout my college education (majoring in molecular biology) i have observed the complexities of the single-cell, and find it impossible to believe that it occurred by accident (though that may not be the best choice of words). the more and more we learn about cellular structure, the more complex we find it is and how these complexities are required in order for life to be present at all.
