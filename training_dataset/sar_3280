currently, in the u.s., when you buy a gun, you don't get it right away. it has to be registered and if you pass a sanity check, they'll approve it. it is because of this registration process that illegal guns are brought into the country and sold..., illegally. if you ban guns, this black market will flourish and the number of unregistered guns will increase. the crazies that want to shoot up a bunch of people will still be able to get a gun. i prefer regulation over making things illegal and banning them. i also prefer freedom over safety. but hey..., that's just me..., well..., me and a bunch of crazed, gun packing, red blooded americans ;)
