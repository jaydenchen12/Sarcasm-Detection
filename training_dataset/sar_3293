sympathetic jurors do not make decisions based on facts. there is no need for you all (y'all) to feel as i do. god forbid we should all think alike. i'm just getting feedback...seeing who really has balls and who doesn't, among other things. i trust all my peers to be human. considering the bell shaped curve of possible reactions to various stimuli, that's not saying much. regarding the mental illness, why don't we just lock up mentally ill murderers for the rest of their lives?..no release for any reason whatsoever including some future psychiatric evaluation that claims the murderer is now ready to go back into society?
