your version of 'serious resistance' is blathering, changing the subject, lying and having no regards for reality. and when that doesn't work you resort to attacking me personally. why don't you get busy debating the substance of my op if you are so sure of yourself....? and by the way....the artwork originally found were authentic and not mass-produced....thousands of them were found and authorities desperately tried to keep them from being revealed to the public.
