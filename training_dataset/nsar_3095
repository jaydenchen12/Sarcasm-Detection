In a way, taking rights away is an American value since we have prescribed methods for doing it. For instance, we have legislatures which posess authority to remove a large number of what you likely consider to be rights. Here are just a small number that come to mind:1) Right to murder2) Right to own slaves3) Right to rape4) Right to abusing children5) Right to vote6) Right to smoke (if you're under 18)7) Right to drink (18th Amendment)8) Right to engage in certain activities in public9) Right to drive as fast as one wants10) Right to dump dangerous chemicals in the nearest riverThe list goes on really. The fact is that you don't object to taking rights away in principle, you only object to taking away those rights that you wish to retain. That is quite inconsistent.Where do you get the idea that one has a right to perform an abortion anyway?
