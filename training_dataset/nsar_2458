As far as I can see, Evolutionists agree that natural selection is how we have evolved for microscopic life forms. To me this means that a single organism in a species mutates, giving it and its offspring an advantage over the rest of the population. If this mutation is random doesn't that mean that the gene pool for every species would be very small as, in the long run, only the offspring of the mutated species would survive?
