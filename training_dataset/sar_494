‰ÛÏEither God exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question. The existence of God is a scientific question, like any other.‰ÛThis is idiotic. Science investigates material phenomena, observable entities in the universe. No competent theologians or philosophers ‰ÛÒ not even the atheist ones ‰ÛÒ have ever declared that God (if he exists) is an object in his own universe. Perhaps there is no God, and intelligent Christians readily admit that there may be some legitimate doubt. But if the Judaeo-Christian God exists, then he is the maker of the universe and not an entity within it.
