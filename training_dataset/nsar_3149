I agree, no oath should be taken lightly. However, I believe that a certain amount of interpretation is essential, especially in grey areas that medicine can wander into. Abortion to save the life of the mother is a grey area that doctors have to wrestle with. Separating siamese twins where there is only one heart, allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area. Following an oath such as that to the letter puts things too much in black and white, when a lot of good medicine happens in the shades of grey.
