since we already had one example of a creationist lowlife tactic in the george gaylord simpson quote, i decided to skim the site and see if i could find another. i did. gee, gives the impression that dr. david m. raup, curator of geology, museum of natural history, chicago, puts little stock in the fossil record and rejects evolution, helping support the preceding assertion that surely one‰Ûªs belief in evolution based on paleontology can scarcely be considered scientific. but that‰Ûªs not at all what dr. raup was stating. while googling for a fuller quote, i ran across a page that showed how this ‰ÛÒ and many other ‰ÛÒ statements by dr. raup were distorted by creationists.  to start with, here is a fuller quote: the page linked to just above explains how a letter was sent to dr. raup asking for his statements about how he had been quoted by a creationist journal (one of the quotes being the one being addressed here). of course dr. raup‰Ûªs reply shows that he does not reject the fossil record, nor evolution, nor the fact that the fossil record documents evolution. the page also lists numerous other creationist distortions of dr. raup's statements.
