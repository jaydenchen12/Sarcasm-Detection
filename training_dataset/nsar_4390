why are there so many people that express interest in who i love? (a rhetorical question) why are there so many people that express interest in how i love? (also a rhetorical question) with all of the atrocities in this country and the world, it seems so odd that politicians and those of 'religion,' as well as the public in general, are so interested in our personal lives. why can't the politicians and those of 'religion' and the public in general place their interest in the atrocities?  and to negate an expected reply, who i love and how i love is not an atrocity in any way.
