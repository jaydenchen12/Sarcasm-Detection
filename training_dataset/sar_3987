you don't leave a lot of room for disagreement moose. all one must do to get pounced on by you all as a group is to say we disagree with the lifestyle and we are immediately attacked as christianistas/christers/christianists bigots. homophobic haters who want to oppress and destroy you. but none of what you accuse me of being is true which is why it rolls of me like water off a duck. and i realize my truth is hard and painful to receive but it is spoken in love and out of an eternal concern for you. if what i believe is true, and it is; and i really felt about gays as you say i do, then why would i tell you about the good news of salvation in the hope of spending eternity with you ? explain that if you can.
