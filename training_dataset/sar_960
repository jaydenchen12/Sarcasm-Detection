Locked door sounds good to me.Are we assuming that the hijacker also has a gun? Or would otherwise it result in a duel with plastic forks and the purple thing left over from lunch?Trouble is this question leads to the next one- would you prefer to possibly have a passanger with a gun, a the hijacker almost certainly with one. Or neither having a gun?
