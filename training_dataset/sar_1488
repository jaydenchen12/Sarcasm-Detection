So you respond with yet another fundie website. While it is technically correct that Kinsey thought there were only a small number of completely homosexual people, he reported exactly the same about heterosexuals - he claimed that most people were somewhere on a contiuum between homo and hetero sexuality. Surveys always underreport the number of gay people because there is still a social stigma attached to being gay. Many surveys report that even those who have engaged in same-sex activity usually consider themselves straight.
