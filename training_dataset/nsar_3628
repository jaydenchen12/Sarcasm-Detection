very true! every organism alive or dead is an intermediate between one species and another... i may be picking at straws here, but when creationists say 'show me an intermediate fossil' they want to see a fish out of water sort of business. the mudskipper is an extraordinary case because it is an intermediate to satisfy the creationists question, but its undeniably observable that its an intermedate form between fish and amphibians. ive stumped numerous creationists with this little guy.
