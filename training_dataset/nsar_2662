The phrase "#### hits the fan" refers to what would happen if such an event occurred, a big mess. For example "Big Jimmy just found out Sly Jones was sleeping with his wife, the #### is really going to hit the fan now!"Substituting something else into the metaphor other than #### renders it meaningless, its unclear what would happen if a "theory" hit a fan, are you trying to say it would make a mess, that nothing would happen, that it would spin in circles?
