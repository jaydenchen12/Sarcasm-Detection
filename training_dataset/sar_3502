i would love to see the evidence for that. alas, there is none. i think there one italian archelogist who claims he found some drawings that he believes that the 'mount sinia' mentioned is different than generally accepted, but i am skeptical of his claims. there are enough screwballs and religious nuts pretending to be archelogists in israel that it takes more than a concensus of 1 for me to consider something. this guy does seem to be more educated than the vendyl jones crowd in archeology, but still a bit on the fringe. maybe he'll get more attention, and provide a good set of evidence, because it is the people on the fringe that are needed to shift the paradiam.. (then they are visionary, rather than on the fringe).
