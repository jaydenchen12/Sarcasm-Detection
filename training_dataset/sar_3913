yes, we do. and the truth is a person, jesus christ (john 14:6).  has any major truth concerning jesus' life, death, or resurrection in the new testament ever been shown to have been substantially changed or proven wrong? no!  if you claim otherwise, prove it.  one other thing: when were the books of the new testament written? scholars give their expert opinions: dating the nt too bad you're so steeped in denial over christ that you can't see the forest for the trees. 1 john 2:22-23: 'who is the liar? it is the man who denies that jesus is the christ. such a man is the antichristhe denies the father and the son. no one who denies the son has the father; whoever acknowledges the son has the father also.' jesus is lord!
