What I have the guts to do is to submit to Gods perfect understanding and not hold the eternal God of time and space to the limited perspective which we have as finite beings. To claim superior knowledge to a perfect, holy and eternal God is the epitome of "arrogance" which you obviously are not lacking. I am humble enough and introspective enough to look at my own past, recognize my own human frailties, nature and shortcoming and humble myself before His perfect wisdom and knowledge to see clearly that which isn't clear to me at the time.Also, just to clarify, God hasn't told me or anyone else to kill anyone enmasse in 2000 years since the advent of the Age of Grace which Jesus, our Messiah ushered in.
