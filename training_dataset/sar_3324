so you don't consider a woman's right to vote a civil right??? interesting. emoticonxwow  the civil rights act of 1964 and the amendments were the most relevant and influential elements in civil rights--it seems the trend these days in your movement is to not use acts and amendments but instead to use the courts as a means to an end to avoid using an act or amendment. probably because you know you have a snowball's chance in hell of getting one.
