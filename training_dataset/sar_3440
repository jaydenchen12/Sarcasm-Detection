no.. go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do. it sounds like you're talking about something you know little about. god didn't want us to be puppets. he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted - and if they didn't want to love him, it should be their choice. if sin wasn't created, we would have been god's puppets.
