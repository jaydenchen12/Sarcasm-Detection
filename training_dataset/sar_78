see for yourselves. the fact remains that in the caribbean, the small towns and the pre-invasion african countries, poverty and crime was near nil. yes criminals existed, but not in the rampant way we see today. and yes people had no money, but everyone was self-sufficient and contented with the standard of life. there were no huge social gaps like there are today.
