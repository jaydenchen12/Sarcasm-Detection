All they are really pressing for is basically for kids parents to tell their kids AT HOME that god guided evolution without it contrasting directly with what the kids are being taught at school. Personally, I see no problem with this, as long as they stick to the facts in any case. Just glanmcing over the proposed changes, I am not seeing anything that is factually incorrect.
