Heading further down that path...If the "right" belongs to the child, then the "right" obviously also DOES NOT belong to those opposed to gays.More specifically, the "right" to WAIVE potential parents as ineligible does not belong to those who are opposed to gays.The "right" would belong to the child to decide who HE/SHE wants, and it would be a bigger usurpment of this right of the child to DENY the child the option of gay parents than it is to present him with the option.
