Just so we're clear, your position is because christians lived in the US, therefore the US was founded as a christian nation? That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Sam Walton was a christian, and many christians worked in his first stores and continue to do so, so using your logic Wal-Mart is a christian company "founded on Judeo-Christian precepts" (which you still have failed to list or support in any way).
