to ss, results from new mutations are by definition different from the normal, so your objection makes no sense. no one is disputing that there are serious negative side effects with the sickle cell trait. however, in terms of the reproductive success of families with sickle cell vs those without, the ones with the trait do better overall than the ones without, in areas severely beset with malaria and in times before medicine, despite the negative effects. the positives outweigh the negatives, so the sickle cell trait is therefore beneficial in terms of natural selection.
