I reckon that evolution is still just a theory for a valid reason. It is untrue and cannot be proven. Darwin himself said that his theory would be proven or disproven based on the future discovery of transitional fossils. There have been NO such fossils ever found.That being the case, even Darwin agrees that the theory of evolution is just man's folly. Ya'll can write millions of words about evolution, but what you lack is the proof of one discovery of transitional fossils The fact of the matter is that God created man in his own image. Case closed.
