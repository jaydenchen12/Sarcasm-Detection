In a 78-22 vote, the senate voted to confirm Judge Roberts for the position of Chief Justice of SCOTUS. My impression of the man, so far, is that he seems to be a man of integrity, a brilliant lawyer, and very humble. The proceedings went very smooth, except for the obligatory parade of left-wing special interest groups. Well, now the fun begins with the second nominee to succeed retiring justice Sandra Day O'Connor. My money is on either Priscilla Owens or Janice Rogers-Brown. Your thoughts.
