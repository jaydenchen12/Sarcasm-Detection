i love tattoos, i've got three so far, a dragon that takes up my right calf, a tribal design on my back and darwin's tree of life on the inside of my left forearm modified to include family initials at branch points with the 'i think' wording on top at my wrist, i also had it thickened up to make it look less like a squiggly hand sketch. the left arm tat is only the start of a sleeve which i plan to cover the entire left arm leading to a merger with the black tribal on my back. i also have plans with my tattooist to put black cat from spiderman as drawn by j scott campbell in there somewhere and to get my family's names and the mantra 'natura non facit saltum in elvish along both of my outer forearms.
