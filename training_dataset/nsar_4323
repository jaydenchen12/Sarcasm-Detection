woopiee... i would have to say that you are putting yourself deeper and deeper into the ccoi every post you are making. you see, this is talking about 'biblical creation'... you know, taking genesis literally, and all that type of nonsense. there are many deeply religious christians that have no problem in accepting that genesis is a story, and not historically accurate. it takes someone profoundly stupid and ignorant to pull that stuff out of their rear. and like i said, 'undisputable' is totally stupid.. because even if the evidence is 100 percent positive, you have xxxxxx that will dispute it.  i mean, this link has undisputable evidence of horse evolution, yet you will dispute it anyway horse evolution over 55 million years
