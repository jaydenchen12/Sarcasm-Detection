The planet is united except for liberalism.then who, why be so afraid?they will half half our percapita income in a generation at current pace. But even if the became purely Jeffersonian and did pass us we will always be the Father of freedom and liberty. before Jefferson that was true.so great they followed Mao to 60 million dead, and now they follow Jefferson.
