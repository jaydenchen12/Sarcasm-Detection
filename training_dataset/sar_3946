that's why we hold the trial before the execution, not after.  wow, the system works. almost executed is not the same thing as executed. and again, while i know it does happen from time to time, how many cases can you provide as examples where someone was sentenced to death, and later exhonerated from all charges? i bet not too many.  ~'we have executed too many innocent people in this country!' *'who?' ~'well, we almost executed them.' lol, i love it. :)
