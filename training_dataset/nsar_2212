If abortion is made illegal I predict that you will see across the border abortion clinics, in canada and states that still premit abortion. Are we to fill the prisons with those seeking abortions in places where it is legal if they live in states that do not allow abortions? Prolifers better becare for what they wish for. Prolifers tend to be conservative and do not like taxes. They better get ready to pay, in taxes, for the extra prisons and social programs needed for all those abandoned children.
