i honestly don't care what you believe about my comment but the reality is you were prejudice about it while at the same time claiming i was the prejudice one. it honestly makes me laugh because it was that ironic. the simple fact that i rarely/never use the word 'lifestyle' for 'gay' would indicate that i meant something different than 'gay'.  unlike many i use words that i find represent what i try to get across. for those that don't know what the word 'lifestyle' means i have taken the liberty to post it for you below: the habits, attitudes, tastes, moral standards, economic level, etc., that together constitute the mode of living of an individual or group. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lifestyle
