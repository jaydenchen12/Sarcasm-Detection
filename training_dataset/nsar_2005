"Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all have many guns (though not nearly as many handguns as does the United States). The key difference is that these countries do a much better job than we do of keeping guns out of the wrong hands. Their experience shows that when there are reasonable restrictions, relatively few outlaws can possess or use guns. " -http://www.vahv.org/NEJM-ed.html I am 100% in favor of outlaws not having guns. If you have not noticed, 3 groups of people can not have guns in this country.1) The insane2) Criminals3) Domestic violence perpsIt is currently illegal for outlaws to have guns. Passing another law will just make outlaws "double-lly" illegal. NO MORE LAWS are need. ENFORCEMENT of current laws is what is needed.If law #1 is not enforced, what makes you think law #2 will be enforced?
