nfa, not nra - but your point remains... 'to his credit/discredit' is largely irrelevant to my point, however - i wasn't attempting to insult his personality. however, the fact that he represents the nfa strongly implies that he has a pro-gun bias; something which should definitely be considered when reading an opinion piece, which the op is an example of. when someone says 'there is no convincing evidence for x', you have to look at what biases they may have about x which might cause them to set their requirements for 'convincing' to be higher - or lower! - than a less biased author would.
