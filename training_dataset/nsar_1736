It's technically not killing. Killing means making it dead. For the most animals, the indicator for life is brain activity (Note: brain activity is one of the requirements of life, but it's not THE definition). When the sperm meets the egg, there is no brain activity. In fact there maybe no brain activity until the end of the first trimester.
