Why don't you try reading what others post then slow down and think about what they said and WHO actually said it,... before you make a fool out of yourself and waste everyone's time and bandwidth?The 12 Trillion dollar debt that I posted about (Not Archie) was to show we don't have the funds for National healthcare. We don't have the funds for Medicare, Medicaide or Social Security either.But, why am I even hopeful that you will take any of that into consideration. You don't seem to have the aptitude for it.
