I have posted this before, but I will post it again to filter out the digressive posts of the anti-gun people... I guess they were hoping to change the subject to something they could debate, but it didn't seem to work, now did it?Statistically, tobacco kills nine times as many people as all homicides and gun accidents combined, and alcohol kills almost twice as many as die in gun-related deaths. (src)Even if you count suicides (assuming every single one of them was with a gun, which they weren't), alcohol still kills more people. So, if your intention is to save lives, then why don't you ban this stuff? Could it have something to do with the fact that you enjoy alcohol and tobacco?
