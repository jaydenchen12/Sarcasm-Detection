Our local school district rents out school buses to groups and rents building facilities out for events all the time. It is smart....they have the resources on hand and it provides a little extra money for the district. Granted that explanation does not fit your agenda, and it would be much easier for you to make your point if we all ignored the most LIKELY solution and instead accepted your EXTREMELY UNLIKELY solution at face value, but you cant actually expect people with any intelligence at all to do that.
