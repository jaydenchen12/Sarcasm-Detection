well, if god actually exist than so would hell, and who would want to go there. again, enlightened self-interest. :) i thought that sin was defeated by christ's 'sacrifice'? why? why not? aferall that is the only true way to either prove or disprove the existence of god. you could have believed in one god and died and discovered that you believed in th wrong god. i'm just keeping all of my options open. :)
