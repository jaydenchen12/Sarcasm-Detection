Saving lives is a Republican goal?Then, why have the Republicans condemned us to this ugly, nonproductive war in Iraq?The terrorists continue to terrorize us because we have deterred our efforts against them to Iraq, (and Bush intends to widen this nonproductive war into Iran and Syria) where nearly 700,000 Iraqis have been needlessly slaughtered, where more than 3,000 of our young have been sacrified in vain, and you have the audacity to say that "saving lives is a Republican goal."Meanwhile we burn Saudi Arabian oil and by so doing, fuel the funding of countless schools of hate against the United States throughout the world.Osama bin Laden, the prime terrorist in the world, issued out of Saudi Arabia. He was funded by Saudi Arabia. Most of the terrorists on those planes that attacked my nation on September 11, 2001, were from Saudi Arabia.Iraq had nothing to do with that attack. Iran had nothing to do with that attack. Syria had nothing to do with that attack.Ever had an attack of reality, Gman?
