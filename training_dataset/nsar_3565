lol. this entire argument is so inane.  it's entirely based on the assumption that the bible is true. obviously that is the fallacy of begging the question.  the bible as a whole is unverifiable, and for all we know was written back in the day by a guy who overdosed on opium.  the idea of rapture is completely irrevelant until the bible is verified as fact.
