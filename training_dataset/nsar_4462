nslation: the government will tell the citizens what kind of bank account they need to get to save up for their own health costs -- then pay it yourself. We constantly hear that a major reason for the increase in health care costs is the cost of the uninsured. How does it help it tell low-income/unemployed/minimum wage workers to save their money? Once again, businesses will love this. Don't offer health insurance to employees - they're self insured. Or they can get it themselves through their church!?!?
