Eugene Volokh ‰Û¢ July 29, 2010 11:48 pm  Friday, the Michigan Supreme Court handed down an interesting case ‰ÛÓ People v. Dupree on this. The case is not novel, and my sense is that the defense is generally recognized: Just as what would otherwise be the crime of murder, attempted murder, battery, and the like might be justified if done in defense against an imminent threat, so a felon‰Ûªs taking possession of a gun is justified if done in defense against an imminent threat. (The defense does not apply to a felon‰Ûªs arming himself against a possible threat of attack at some indefinite future time.) Still, the case struck me as an interesting illustration. Thanks to Jason C. Miller for the pointer.
