Oh man. You keep ignoring the HISTORICAL CONTEXT of the issue. Back in 1967, "societal views of marriage" meant SAME RACE MARRIAGE ONLY, by an overwhelming majority that supercedes that seen today against gay marriage. By a margin of 3 to 1, people DISAPPROVED of interracial marriage. Society "viewed" marriage as "between a man and a woman of the same race".
