no, it's because there is no evidence of their existence. for instance, we can not see air, but we have evidence of its existence. the most valid argument is that there are planets that can support life. i say it's valid because this is true (unlike other alien arguments). but this is not a good argument for alien existence because the conditions themselves do not prove life. they just prove conditions.
