3a) If you do the math, severe earthquakes (caused by God) could have very easily covered the Earth in approximately 2 miles of water at some points. Also, with these severe earthquakes, not all of the Earth would have to be covered equally at one time. There could have been some parts shallow enough to actually see the ground below.3b) Who said the Earth started out as a flat super continent? I believe that God made the Earth only a few thousand years ago, not that much geographically different from the way it is now.
