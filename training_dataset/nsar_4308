stabbing yourself is not ok, but that doesn't mean it should be illegal. i'm not even going to bother with your non-sequitor, but i imagine plenty of alcohol manufacturers enjoy the occasional drink. of course guns are only used to hurt others by criminals - shooting someone is a criminal act. unfortunately by the time you find out that the person is a criminal their victim is bleeding out on the floor. illegal guns are generally guns that were previously held legally, whether they have been modified or stolen.
