According to Jesus in the New Testament, here is hate and family values..."If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."Luke 14:26 (KJV) "For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."Matthew 10:34"And everyone that hath foresaken houses, brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life."Matt. 19:29"And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death." Matthew 10:21
