there are no criminal penalties for private individuals and organizations violating the constitutional rights of other private individuals. your backpack and person may be searched without a warrant if they have reason to suspect you of having stolen something. as there are no penalties that means there is no crime having been committed. the civil rights act of 1964 is another matter of discussion entirely. unfortunately until lower court cases build precedent to show that firearms ownership is a civil right and will be treated as such there is nothing that can be done when private individuals choose to prohibit firearms on said property.
