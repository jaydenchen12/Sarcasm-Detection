According to this, there are 1,531,764 crimes stopped by guns this year (and it's not even the end of the year yet!). It also gives a reasonable explanation of why you don't see this on the news every day. It also says that legal gun owners account for almost 0% of all gun crime. So if you want to ban guns, 1,531,764 people will get killed or injured, and you'll only take guns out of the hands of those who don't even commit gun crimes.
