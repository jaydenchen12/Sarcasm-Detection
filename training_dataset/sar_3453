when we demean the holocaust, and the symbols supporting it, we begin to erase those lessons. so you are saying we should try and forget about it? learning about the holocaust is great, and as horrible as it sounds it is probably for the better that it happened. why do i say this? well if it hadn't happened then it would have happened eventually (almost everyone hated jews, blacks and homosexuals at the time), and it happening taught us a valuable lesson. it's horrible to look at it like that; but it is quite true, whether you think so or not. we need things like this to happen in order to grow and develop and mature as a species.
