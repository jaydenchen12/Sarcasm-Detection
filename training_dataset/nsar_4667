actually, yes i do support full medical care for our veterans with injuries sustained while serving their country. i don't know why you would think i don't. the issue is that the government has never done anything efficiently or effectively within estimated budgetary constraints. name one government agency or beaurocracy which runs within its budget.  and the estimated cost for this socialized medicine is 2 trillion dollars over what, 10 years? and the estimated actual costs are trillions more than that very conservative estimate. but you don't care about facts. you don't even want to take the time to actually read the bill. just pass it now and worry about the consequences later.  print up more money until a dollar isn't worth a mexican peso. emoticonxgood
