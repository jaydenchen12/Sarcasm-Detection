this is what easyrider doesn't understand. your story was jesus's whole point. though actions of love we will know god. easyrider and his kind do not know jesus. i actually feel sorry for him and pity him he can not see jesus in another human being and is so addicted to the bible, and the teachings of the false god paul, that he and his kind have made it their god. they are trapped within the confines of thier own teachings. jesus said only as a little child can you enter the kingdom of heaven. see the world though the eyes of a little child and all things are possible. don't let the fear based rantings of easyrider get to you. remember love is always the answer.
