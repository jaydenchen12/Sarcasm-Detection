and not that i did either... hijacking? hijacking is the seizing of something by use of force. the unborn baby was forced to be there...not the other way around. but you don't have 100% personal autonomy and never will. is this really that hard to see? well those 'slave owning white guys' (of which not all of them had slaves and most of them knew slavery needed to be ended) founded your country and established the government by which you feel protects your 'right to abortion' or 'personal autonomy'...eventhough they never established this....
