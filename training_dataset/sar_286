How do we rationally explain these creatures existence so recently in our human history if they were extinct for millions of years? And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe, then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence? And while your at it, ask yourself if it's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust?
