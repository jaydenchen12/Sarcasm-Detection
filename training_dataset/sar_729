what i am saying is that there are people on mars, but they have not been yet discovered. there are cities and towns, there are seas and rivers, there are mountains and plains. mars is different from our moon, and different from either of venus and mercury. moon has no water, no atmosphere and no life thereon. http://universeandquran.site.io/new_...urney_to_moon_ venus has stopped its axial rotation, and has undergone many serious changes concerning its atmosphere which became some thick smoke and mixture of gases, in addition to the increase in the temperature of the day-side that is continuously facing the sun, and the extreme coldness and freezing of the other night-side; this has led to the extermination of life upon venus. http://universeandquran.site.io/new_..._is_dangerous_ mercury had stopped its axial rotation, a long time before venus, and such serious changes in its atmosphere and the temperature extremity occurred before those on venus. then mercury lost most of its atmosphere, because of the weakness of its gravity; then mercury had been exposed to the falling of large numbers of comets upon it. and all such circumstances had led to the extermination of life upon mercury. http://universeandquran.site.io/new_...axial_rotation  http://universeandquran.site.io/new_...he_burnt_world  but the case is different for mars: its atmosphere is clear, it includes the cloud drifted by the wind, there is the alternation of the night and day, and seasons, and the polar regions of mars include water in the form of ice.  moreover, the high mountains include ice on their tops. and not all the planet is covered by ice. and certainly they have made many mistakes and have not yet discovered the life on mars, which is expected to be known in the near future.  http://universeandquran.site.io/new_...is_successful_ eanassir http://universeandquran.site.io
