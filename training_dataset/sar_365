It's an entirely different type of relationship though. That's not arguing "against gays"--it's stating the obvious. Doesn't mean one is any superior or inferior to the other. Doesn't mean one is worth more or less. It's just different.(And by the way, don't think it's not all-too-obvious that you lifted the "credibility" line from Thelmoose's comments to Jim.)
