well its not...aren't you more concerned about those people that have a abortions after unprotected sex? no i'm not. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? what result? describe to me the result and we'll see if its the same. well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either..
