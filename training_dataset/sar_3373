i would like to add, i don't necessarily agree with the health care reform that obama passed, but i will applaud the fact that he actually passed something concerning health care. all the previous presidents since reagan have promised health care and never delivered. they ran on health care, and once elected did nothing . at least obama kept his promise to address the subject. maybe it could have been a better plan, but what we have now is better than the nothing we've had under mostly republicans.. clinton being the only democrat who also failed to deliver ....
