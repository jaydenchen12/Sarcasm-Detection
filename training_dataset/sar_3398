something is only dumb to those that cannot comprehend. is a student dumb or the teacher too dumb to teach? one does not train a dog to sit, lay down, crawl, etc, the dog already knows how to do these things. what you do train a dog to do, respond to a command. in order for this to happen one must be smarter than the dog or at least of equal intelligence.  senseless you say. numbers don't matter. how about size? ask your partner.  what purpose does your life have? what is that thing that drives you? mine is to share what i have learned. no one share this with, no reason to move forward. a painter with no brush. passion lost and all else with it.
