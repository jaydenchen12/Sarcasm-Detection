you don't seem to want a written constitution either, or at least one that isn't as vauge as ours. i have gathered from your posts that you want a direct democracy, where everyone gets to vote on each others rights. you want the people to be able vote on such issues as abortion, and marriage, you want a tryanny of the majority. any one who wants people to be able to vote upon the civil rights of another is an enemy of freedom.
