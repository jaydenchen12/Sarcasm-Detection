andy, this is a waste of space becuase honestly, you haven't heard anything what trumph can offer to the united states. if you post this for fun, i understand but if you post this as a serious topic, then this is stupid. trumph haven't said anything about his political views so how can you compare him to obama who has.  for now, obama seems like the better candidate. :)
