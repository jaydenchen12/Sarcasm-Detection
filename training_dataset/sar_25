Besides, until you can show where Christians are walking into crowded marketplaces detonating body-attached explosives) .QUOTE]((Besides, until you can show where Christians are walking into crowded marketplaces detonating body-attached explosives,))I'd like to address this if I could, although the example I'm giving is not gay related, I'm am curious to see how you would respond to me asking about how Christians who are anti abortionist, will bomb clinics and murder the Doctors who perform the procedures? My point being it does relate to the OP original point? You can't pick and choose who it's OK to kill,, and gays and lesbians are a legitimate minority.
