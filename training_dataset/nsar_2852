As much as I'd love pacifism and peace and tolerance and all that wonderful stuff, and I do believe, as my signature says, that violence is the last refuge of the incompetent, it can't be helped so long as we live in a world where people think they need violence. I say take a few pacifistic Earthlings, resettle them on other planets, and build nice and peaceful Spacer worlds away from the violence and squalor of this planet. :)
