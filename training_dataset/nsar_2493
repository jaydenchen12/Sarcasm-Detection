OK, I'll play.Assuming a fetus is a person, it depends on the body and organs of the host to live. It will put the host's body through stress and discomfort for months, possibly even cause it to die, at the very least it will change that body forever.No person can be compelled to give organs, tissue, or blood against their will, even to save the life of another. This is SO fundamental that not even condemned prisoners can be so compelled. Forcing a woman to use her organs to support another person is the same thing and should be forbidden the same way.
