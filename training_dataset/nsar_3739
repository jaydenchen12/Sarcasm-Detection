the problem, however, becomes more manageable once you realize that all you need is a computer with a database that shows where all the food/water hoarders live. no such database exists, to the best of my knowledge; certainly not one we could gain access to. and in any event, post-apocalypse technology will be limited to things that operate without electricity, for the most part, so maintaining and powering a computer after the end of the world would be pretty much impossible. i think you need to take your plan back to the drawing board, as it all hinges on this one ill conceived idea.  also, even if your computer idea worked and was a reality, you just told a whole bunch of people about it, so now you have unwanted competition.
