Its pretty clear that the attributes of God were made up along the way over the course of history, for different motivations from explaining disasters and natural phenomenon, to comforting greiving loved ones, to controlling the masses and justifying the whims of the rulers. When things started to get hairy in terms of logical contradictions, they threw in "God moves in mysterious ways" and "God's ways are higher than ours", in an attempt to shut up the independent thinkers with questions the priests couldn't answer. Truly genius, the legacy still goes strong to this day.
