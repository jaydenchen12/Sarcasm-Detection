They don't...but that's the principle issue behind many ACLU lawsuits and protests regarding treatment of criminals, especially if they get hurt while committing the crime. I will agree that they deserve a fair trial, but that is about all they deserve...if they live through their attempt to harm the victim. If they die trying to harm the victim, we are spared the cost of a trial.You are spot on regarding the lack of ethics or morality in the perps. They are being neither ethical nor of high moral standing...why should I have to be in my defense?
