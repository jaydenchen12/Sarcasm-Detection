here in san francisco, hiv is talked about all the time. a frank discussion on the national level would be a welcome change, especially since the bush administration wants to cut back on the prevention programs that have worked here. and here are a couple more articles: new cases of hiv in san francisco dipped nearly 10% in the last five years, marking the first drop in infections since the late 1980s, according to preliminary estimates from the city's department of public health. the first one is from sfgate, so you probably won't trust it, tainted as it is by just being in san francisco. la is probably too librul for you to trust, too, so you may just have to google and see if fox covered the decrease in rates. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/articl...ag5ii16js1.dtl http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la...nes-california
