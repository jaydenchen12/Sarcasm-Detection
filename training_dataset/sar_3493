part of me feels the syrians need to fight it out like every other country did, but the other half feels the war needs to be stopped. if there is an intervention, it needs to be done properly. by that i mean no nato countries. the intervention should be made up of arab un troops in blue helmets. this ensures there are no ulterior motives of the forces.
