Have you read my "signature" lately? By asking God for forgiveness of your sins, asking him to come into your heart and govern your life, and following His commandments, you don't have to go to hell. Everyone is a sinner...it's whether or not you ask God for FORGIVENESS and decide to CHANGE that gets you into heaven. Yes, gays go to hell. They sin and do not change their sinful ways or ask for forgiveness.
