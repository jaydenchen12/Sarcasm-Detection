if you really respected my belief, or lack thereof, my kids wouldn't be asking me what god is because they hear it in the pledge and read it on our money. they wouldn't be constantly bombarded with your beliefs when it's against my own that they be taught such rubbish. everywhere that atheists try to strip the government's endorsement of a belief in god we are fought be theists in their attempt to maintain this endorsement. if you really respected my belief you'd keep yours to yourself without trying to spread it to me and my family. until then, i'll continue to promote the fact that the 'big invisible guy in the sky' is just another fairy tale.
