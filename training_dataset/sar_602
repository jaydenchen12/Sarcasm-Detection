It has moved on to The Scientific Theory of Evolution.Hmm, so given this exhibition of ignorance of what Evolution is, you are saying that because you never heard of mutations, Evolution doesn't work? That's a problem with your ignorance, not with the Scientific Theory of Evolution.It changes ratios of gene alleles in a population., which certainly fits the definition of Evolution (Namely, "the changes in alleles in a population over generational time)."RM&NS"????But then, there also is absolutely no evidence for such an intelligence.False.Quite. But then neither does many living systems. Unless you deliberately engage in revisionist linguistic hyperbole to change the definition of "purposefully" or "intelligently," your argument is outright false.Blatantly false.Blatantly false.Blatantly false.What is this? Some kind of "I'll will make a false presentation of living entities and use this falsehood to disprove Evolution" ####? If your argument is based on outright falsehoods like you just did, then the output will be false as well. Remember the old computer programmer term - "garbage in, garbage out."
