every person should attempt to preserve what they hold dear.  if the atheist is a objectivst who loves the ideal of freedom and capatalism then they will probably support a battle against the terrorists. if the atheist is a communist, he may not really care if america is destroyed. (i only mentioned objectivst and communist as examples i am aware that their are other forms of atheism and i do not need to be informed of this. i'm also aware that not all communists are atheists.) what do you mean 'the civil rights of terrorists'. i haven't heard any atheists or non atheists suggest such a thing.
