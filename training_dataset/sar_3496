honest. what can i say? if nothing else the bush presidency has shown us that having a president who lies every time he opens his mouth is a bad thing.  she does not have enough background to say for sure. while she has instituted some conservative programs in alaska, she also championed the biggest social giveaway of any state ever. she did not even hide it...jsut taxed the oil companies and gave the cash to the people. that is about as socialist as you get.  cant say for sure on nancy pelosi. she looks like a half trained shimp next to hillary. hillary clinton may be evil,but she is smart.
