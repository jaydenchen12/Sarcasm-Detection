1) It's hardly "solved".Same-sex marriage is not legal in France. As of 2006, one same-sex marriage ceremony has been conducted in France and was declared void. France has a statute authorizing civil unions, known as PACS, between same-sex and unmarried opposite-sex couples.Same-sex marriage was an issue in the 2007 presidential election, with the Conservative UMP opposing it and the Socialist Party supporting it, though both candidates support civil unions (PACS).....On June 5, 2004, former Green Party presidential candidate NoÌÇl MamÌ¬re, Mayor of the Bordeaux suburb of BÌ¬gles, conducted a same-sex marriage ceremony for two men, Bertrand Charpentier and StÌ©phane Chapin. MamÌ¬re claimed that there was nothing in French law to prohibit such a ceremony, and that he would appeal any challenge to the European Court of Human Rights.French Justice Minister Dominique Perben had stated that such unions would be legally void, and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony.Same-sex marriage in France - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWhat France has is "well, both the blacks and the whites can enter by the side-door, but only the whites can enter by the main door"We wouldn't find such an "acommodation" satisfactory for blacks.And furthermore, I think you would find that it's the ANTI-GAYS who have the problem with this.If Obama is able to try to put up "civil unions" on the federal level, you can bet dollars to doughnuts it will be the religious right who fight him.Not the gays...
