i agree to the fllest extent. 'white' is only a color metaphor. in reality, the people in europe are comprised from 12 different 'races.' i can name my own; germanic, and celt, slavic, and dinaric(italian-greek) are others as well. each race has its sub-races. germanics and celts are expected to go exitnct in less than two centuries anyhow. i'm helping to speed up the process by not having kids!
