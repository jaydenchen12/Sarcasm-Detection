It's just a term for someone who has decided to live in a way that isn't gay. They may be "gay" physiologically (whatever that means in terms of biology), but they are living in a way that doesn't give in to that--which is what matters from their religious standpoint. Many people live against urges (regarding various issues) all the time. Ironically, gay pride has itself largely to blame for the 'ex-gay' movement. I think it's an example of some gays swinging back against the 'out-and-proud' far left shift--religious gays are, in effect, saying they don't have to abide by your prescription for their lives.
