okemoticonxrolleyes people who make the law,people who influence the people who make the law,people who interpret the law. they set the perameters to your freedom and rights. your 'rights' and' freedoms' are what they want them to be not necessarily what you want them to be..therefore they are not necessarily rights or freedoms are they? i am ok with that to a point but in the uk at least i think they are unfair to some . i never said they should be unlimited. is that ok or do you need a stick drawing?emoticonxclown
