I find it interesting that the stars create the clouds and inturn the clouds form into stars. One vicious cycle with no begining. In a forum devoted to origin you offer the explainiation of no origin at all but rather meaningless existence. This is the main problem I have with evolution and it's application to physical sciences. A cycle with no begining has indeed no forseeable end. Therefore on a personal level I have no hope of changing anything. Things were, are and will continue to be this cycle of events. As this applies to biology any other life sciences. My actions are only the result of my animal instict. I am not playing the inner - child but rather the inner - beast. No law is passed to keep a beast in submission to another beast. Governing bodies fail if there is no accountablity. That is the cruix of the discussion. I am accoutable to God. If I am wrong about creation, I have only missed out on a lifetime of animal behavior. If you are wrong about evolution, then I fear you are far the worse off then I.
