i suspect that those statistics are harder to find and harder to determine (since, once a person is dead, there is much less motivation to prove him innocent). nevertheless, various sources mention a number of people who have been executed despite probable innocence. here is just one of numerous sites that i found with a google search. this site (a few years old)claims that 25 people in the last 25 years have been executed despite probable innocence. http://capitaldefenseweekly.com/25casesdraft.html anyway, i don't think there is a formal procedure to establish official innocence after death. i don't think the mechanisms are in place in our justice system to have a trial for the dead, so we can only look at the evidence in the cases that people have privately pursued.
