[quote=toby][quote] the relative context, in this instance, is understood to be the assertion that a moral consensus is limited by a shifting perspective - i.e. changing from time to time and from place to place, etc.  a radical relativist might say that's what attila should do - even assuming you have some heinous behaviour in mind: i'm not. it might be argued that moral sentiments are instinctive. i'm not going quite that distance: i'm saying that moral values are expressions of approval/disapproval that don't arise from rational deliberation, but from the affective part of human nature.
